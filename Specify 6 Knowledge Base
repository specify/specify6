Specify 6 Knowledge Base

Things to document (Theresa  2021-10-11)
●	Web portal 
○	especially related to combining collections and exports
○	Share assetServer, in a separate repo
○	Not directly connected to sp6
●	Understanding Specify 6 Data Model and codebase - Max working on documenting and viz tools
●	Conversions - data munging and SQL
●	Hibernate + SQL - where, when, why
●	Assess Specify 7 readiness (to match Specify 6), Tim not needed here
○	Missing elements, esp security,  user levels, editability of levels, tables, users
○	Usability
○	Document comparing the 2: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ljaD8wWKo_uevqx9pilfX3EyeGpLoWWg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114849937896201929908&rtpof=true&sd=true
●	Trees - understand how they work and differ from Sp 7, all except for storage come with default
○	Taxonomy - default is discipline-specific
○	Geography - standard
○	Storage
○	Stratigraphy (paleo only)
■	Litho- (characteristics)
■	Chrono- (time)
●	Workbench in Sp 6
●	Labels - scripts to create and modify (works similarly in Sp7)
●	Plugins - where and how modified
○	Containers
○	Collection relationships
○	Geo-coordinates
●	Search - similar in Sp 6 and 7
●	Localization and how it interacts with the Schema config
●	Type searches.  Not sure if this is part of understanding the data model and codebase

Aimee/Tim notes 2021-10-6
●	Conversion 
○	scripts and tools 
○	Github - Most scripts in Sp 6 repo
○	Strategies
■	First handle tree - separate out taxonomy and geography 
●	Taxonomy synonyms is a problem
●	Parasite host relationship can be a problem (insects)
■	Generic: Flatten  file first, use uploader
■	Parsing agents etc, lists of agents with one-many,  diff tools, one-offs for individual projects
■	Sometimes put everything in without resolving dupes, remove dupes later
■	Only some collections think of collection events as one to many with  collection object (ex fish).  If no CE, one to one is default
■	Details are the problem - format dates, lat/lon, etc
■	Try to get user to do prep work
○	Stages
○	Sizes - 95% are 3K - 300K, 50K average
●	Specify 6
○	Go through code repo
○	object diagram, process diagram
■	We will whiteboard, and discuss 
○	Schema update process
■	Hibernate does most of the work (adding new things)
■	Modifying existing or dropping things must be done with SQL code
○	Report writer
■	Designer based on 2007 code, not touched > 10 years in Sp6, getting to work in 7
■	Updated Jasper engine but that’s it
○	Hibernate
■	Mixed with SQL b/c Hibernate is so heavy
○	Most difficult: Data entry form 
■	complex and recursive
■	Business rules applied at diff times in the process, Tim goes here first
■	Other ways to fix outside of it
●	Missing Sp7 elements 
○	Schema config
○	Permissions systems
○	Wizard to create/configure databases
○	Workbench is done!
●	Other stuff
○	Export JVM issue
■	JVM args must be built into Windows exe
■	Could experiment with different args/vals on Linux to determine best way, then implement in Windows version
○	Barcelona
○	U of Washington bad data
○	Othersd?


Other considerations
●	Explain commented code
●	Ben can help with building app(s), signing, certificates, etc
●	Tim immediate priorities:
○	Conversion script - minor doc and to github
○	Add package-level explanatory docstrings to files
○	Entry points for other stand-alone apps
■	clear in install4j configuration - which is in packaging directory, top level of source tree
■	Could also look for all the ‘main’ methods
■	Primary apps (maybe 8 total)
●	DB creation wizard
●	Data exporter
●	Security wizard
