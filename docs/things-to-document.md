- [ ] Web portal
  - [ ] especially related to combining collections and exports
  - [ ] Share assetServer, in a separate repo
  - [ ] Not directly connected to sp6
- [ ] Understanding Specify 6 Data Model and codebase - Max working
      on documenting and viz tools
- [ ] Conversions - data munging and SQL
- [ ] Hibernate + SQL - where, when, why
- [ ] Assess Specify 7 readiness (to match Specify 6), Tim not needed here
  - [ ] Missing elements, esp security, user levels, editability of
        levels, tables, users
  - [ ] Usability
  - [ ] Document comparing the 2:

- [ ] Trees - understand how they work and differ from Sp 7, all except
      for storage come with default
  - [ ] Taxonomy - default is discipline-specific
  - [ ] Geography - standard
  - [ ] Storage
  - [ ] Stratigraphy (paleo only)
    - [ ] Litho- (characteristics)
    - [ ] Chrono- (time)
- [ ] Workbench in Sp 6
- [ ] Labels - scripts to create and modify (works similarly in Sp7)
- [ ] Plugins - where and how modified
  - [ ] Containers
  - [ ] Collection relationships
  - [ ] Geo-coordinates
- [ ] Search - similar in Sp 6 and 7
- [ ] Localization and how it interacts with the Schema config
- [ ] Type searches.  Not sure if this is part of understanding the data
    model and codebase
