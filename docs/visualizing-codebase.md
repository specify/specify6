# Visualizing codebase

Specify 6 codebase has close to 2000 Java classes, totaling just over 700,000
lines of code, not to mention countless dependencies (iReport, hibernate,
install4j, ant, etc...).

Java-specific CASE tools can help visualize the codebase and plot the
relationships between classes.
