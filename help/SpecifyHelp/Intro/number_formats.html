       Creating Field Formats
    </h2>
    <p>
       Accession and Catalog Number formats are configured during the institution setup but there
      may be other fields that require either a number scheme or a format. A format allows a field
      to include sections for different data, such as static text, a date or an incremented number.
      Gift Number and Loan Number often have a unique format within collections. These can be
      formatted in the Schema Configuration tool, which will change the format for the entire
      discipline. In other words, if a Gift Number is formatted in the schema configuration, all
      the collections within the discipline will be required to use the new format, which will
      display on the Gift form.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The following steps will help you to create and choose a format for a field in the Field
      Formatting Editor, which is available in the Schema Configuration tool. Field formats for
      Accessions and Catalog Numbers are created when using the Specify Setup Wizard. If you are
      currently using the Specify Setup Wizard to create a Specify database please proceed to the
      <a href="../Intro/number_formats.html#formatting_editor"><em>Field Formatting Editor</em></a>
      section.
    </p>
    <p>
       1. Choose <em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>. The Schema Configuration tool is only
      available to users in a Manager or Administrator group.
    </p>
    <p>
       2. Once in the Schema Configuration tool, choose a table and field from the <em>Table</em>
      and <em>Field</em> lists (on the left side of the tool) respectively.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Field formatting functions are configured using the Format Type section at the bottom of
        the Schema Configuration tool.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       3. Choose <em>Formatting</em> from the pick list next to the Format Type caption.

         1. Begin creating a format by clicking the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16"

      </p>
      <p>

           <strong>Numeric</strong> may only be numbers and can be auto incremented by checking the
          'Is Incrementer' box and using Auto Numbering when entering data. When auto numbering
          Specify will start incrementing from the highest number present for the section within
          the database. A numeric section can be set between 1 and 10 characters in length. To
          start a new count for each year check the <em>Restart counter every year</em> box.
        </p>
        <p>
           It is important to remember that different field formats are implemented at different
          levels and that formats that include a section that is incremented will include a
          numbering scheme that may be shared. For instance, an Accession number can be implemented
          at either an Institution or Division level. An Accession number implemented at a Division
          level configured with 'Is Incrementer' checked will increment in all collections and
          disciplines for that division. In other words, they share a numbering scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
           Collection Numbers are implemented at a Collection level and increment automatically for
          single collections only. Users that wish to increment Collection Numbers between more
          than one collection should <a href="mailto:support@specifysoftware.org">contact Specify staff</a> for
          help setting that parameter.

          located under the <em>Type</em> box. The length of the Constant section limited to the

      <blockquote>
        <p>
           <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When manually entering a formatted number field, it is
          paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a
          numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1
          is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in
          searches, queries and reports.
