<p>Over 250 years of botanical and zoological exploration have produced billions of biological specimens in museums worldwide which document the distribution of life on earth. The Internet has changed the way we catalog, computerize and discover those specimens, but we are just at the beginning of utilizing the communication and computational power of the net. The goal of Specify 6 is to extend collections computing beyond simple specimen description, discovery and data retrieval--to capabilities for integration and synthesis that will enable researchers to utilize collections data for broader, quicker, research impact, in efficient, network-based collaborations.</p>
<p>Specify 6 is based on the same core collections concepts as Specify 5, but has been completely rewritten in Java and can run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It also also greatly updated to allow drag and drop and multi-tasking with only one open application. </p>
<p>Specify is an open source project and welcomes software collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="registration" id="registration"></a>Registration</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The concept of software registration for Specify 6 has changed to align with commercial software practice. A registration popup window request is activated in Specify whenever a new collection database is created. Specify asks the administrator of the database for identifying information such as the name of the collection, contact name and e-mail address. Registration enables online updates of Specify software and adds the registration contact email address to the Specify Project e-mail list for news and announcements. Anyone may register a Specify collection: US or foreign, academic, government or commercial, museum curator, graduate student, or member of the general public. We also accept registrations from collections-based research projects which are not collection catalogs but &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; collections of specimen records aggregated from multiple sources for the purpose of supporting taxonomically or geographically-scoped research. Registration is optional.</p>
  <p>Specify will ask if you want to register the first time it opens and thereafter if you are not registered. </p>
  <p>You can also register by clicking <em>Help &gt; Software Registration</em>. A message will appear telling you that your institution is registered if you do not need to register. </p>
  <p>Institutions that are not registered will not receive automatic updates for Specify 6.</p>

<h4><a name="services" id="services"></a>Services and Support</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Institutional Support Agreements (&quot;ISAs&quot;) are agreements set on paper with U.S. research institutions to formalize a support relationship. With U.S. National Science Foundation funding, U.S. collections institutions have access the Specify Project&rsquo;s professional services for data migration from a legacy systems, Specify customization and configuration support, and miscellaneous other help desk services directly related to the installation and operation of the program. (ISAs are equivalent to Specify 5 registrations.) </p>
  <p>Projects which propose to create specimen or observation species occurrence databases with data from various sources, i.e. virtual collections created for some specific research objective, e.g. Ants of the World, Trees of Madagascar, a multi-institutional collaborative Tree of Life Project, will be eligible to establish an ISA and receive support services from the Project. These project databases are usually scoped systematically or geographically, and are essentially virtual, special-purpose collections. This is an extension of our current Sp5 policy to reflect Sp6&rsquo;s enhanced schema for U.S. research project specimen databases.</p>
  <p>To receive Services and Support:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Contact the Specify Project for the ISA form. </p>
    <p>2. Once you have completed and signed the form, you will receive an ISA Number. </p>
    <p>3. In Specify, on the main menu click <em>Help &gt; Support Agreement.</em> </p>
    <p>4. Type your ISA Number in the dialog that appears. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Once your ISA is complete you will qualify for Specify Support and Updates.</p>

<h4><a name="phui" id="phui"></a>Usage and Usability Statistics</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Usage and Usability Statistics (UUS) communications is a new network feature in Specify 6, which returns information on the frequency of specific Specify component use and information over the Internet to the Specify Project. Specify is instrumented with checkpoints which log whether a particular module was successfully used or whether an internal error (a handled exception) was encountered. This information is highly useful for assessing the usability of particular modules and for identifying engineering defects and prioritizing fixes and enhancements. Our vision with the UUS facility is to connect to Specify users to anticipate their troubleshooting needs by rapidly identifying error conditions, and to prioritize software enhancements based on usage paths and frequency. UUS communications can be turned on or off as a user preference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="updates" id="updates"></a>Auto-updates&nbsp;</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Auto-updates are an automatic software update delivery service built into Specify. It delivers and installs the latest Specify releases automatically to registered installations over the Internet. When Specify is started, the program checks with a Project server to see if there are any updates available and if there are, the user is offered the opportunity to download the update software and install it within Specify. Specify software updates can also be manually obtained at anytime through the &lsquo;Check for Updates&rsquo; option on the Help menu. The online update service will update versions of Specify compiled by the University of Kansas.</p>
  <p>Users with computers that do not have internet access should turn off the 'Check for Updates' function in the System section of User Preferences. For help performing this task visit the <a href="../Prefs/System.html">System Preference </a>help page.</p>
