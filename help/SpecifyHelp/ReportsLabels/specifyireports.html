       <a name="ireport_overview" id="ireport_overview"></a>A report is used to present the results
      of a Query in an attractive and reader-friendly arrangement, either on paper or on screen as
      a report preview.
    </p>
    <p>
       Specify harnesses the power of iReport 3.0, an open source report writing software package,
      by modifying the original iReport version to interact with Queries created in Specify 6 and
      data supplied from the Specify 6 database. &nbsp;Once within SpecifyiReport, the interface is
      identical to that of iReport.
    </p>
    <p>
    For in-depth documentation we recommend the book <em>The Definitive Guide to iReport</em>, which is available from Amazon. </p>
  <p>The following documentation is meant to explain how to bring a Specify Query
      into the Specify 6 version of iReport, then create a simple report.&nbsp;    </p>
<p>
       The Specify staff also provide limited report-writing services for all Specify users with an
      ISA. To benefit from their expertise please contact them at <strong>specify@ku.edu</strong>.    </p>
<p>
       SpecifyiReport ships with Specify but is a separate application and must be launched
      separately from Specify. SpecifyiReport is located in the Specify application
      <em><strong>bin</strong></em> directory, which stores the executable files for Specify.
      Double click <em>the SpecifyiReport</em> executable to launch SpecifyiReport. &nbsp;As with
      Specify, you will be prompted for <a href="../Dialogs/Login.html">login</a> information. In a
      multiple collection scenario you will also be prompted for the collection in which you would
      like to create the Report.
    </p>
    <p>
       Reports can also be written directly in MySQL and then imported into Specify using the <a
      href="../Import/import_export.html">Resource Import/Export</a> tool. The Report needs to
      include this Report Query "where" clause: "where co.collectionobjectid $P!{itemnum} . Also
      include a parameter named "itemnum".
    </p>
    <p>
       Reports are viewed and printed from within Specify. SpecifyiReports does not include a
      preview. However, users can have both Specify and SpecifyiReport open at the same time and
      switch between the two to preview the report or changes being made in Specify. You will need
      to click the <em>Refresh</em> button in the Specify Reports sidebar for changes to be
      updated. For information on printing reports from within Specify, see <a href=
      "../ReportsLabels/reports.html">Reports</a>.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Reports are generated by report definitions, which in turn are  based on Specify Queries.
        Therefore, the first step in creating a Report is to create and save a <a href=
      "../QueryBuilder/Query_Builder.html">Query</a> within Specify. When constructing the query,
        remember that checking the Prompt box for a query field will ensure the option to change the
        criteria for the field before running a report.      </p>

          Once the preliminary set-up is complete, an empty report template will appear. iReport
          separates reports into sections, or bands. Data is then printed according to the band
          definition. For example, a title is printed once, but detail is repeated for every record.
          Bands can be resized by holding the mouse on the separator line until cross hairs appear,
          then clicking and dragging the line. Bands can also be removed if not needed by dragging the
          lower edge of the band onto the upper edge (thereby making its height zero).      </p>

        <p>
          Menus on the side and bottom of the Workspace in iReport are called Panes. It is helpful to
          have three main panes open: <em>Document Structure</em>, <em>Properties</em> and
          <em>Library</em>. These can be opened/closed in <em>View &gt; Docking Panes</em>. Any item
          within these panes can be dragged and dropped into a band. When the item is dropped into a
          band, the expression that represents it is displayed in a Text Field.    </p>
        <p>
          Right-button-click on an object within the panes to display a context menu with choices for
          Edit, Add, Move, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Add a Group and Refresh.    </p>
        <p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Parameters</strong> are the programmatic values created by Specify to print reports
              from SpecifyReport.              </li>
<br />
            <li><strong>Fields</strong> lists the fields in the Query available for inclusion in the

            <li>
              Drag and drop a field into the detail band for inclusion in the report. The field will
              display as a 'textField' in the report structure. This refers to the data, or text, that
              will occupy the field when the report is run. Do not add or delete text inside a text
              field.<br>
              <br>
              The size of the field can be changed by clicking on the field to produce an outline, then
              grabbing one of the boxes on the outline and dragging it.<br>
              <br>
              Change the font or font size for the field data in the Properties pane, or by clicking on
              it to select it and using the font list box and font size list box in the Tool Bar located
              at the top of SpecifyiReport.<br>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Common</strong> lists properties for the band such as size, background color, and

              The third section is object specific (Barcode for barcodes, Image for images) and includes
              some useful expressions. An expressions is a combination of variables, constants, and
              functions linked by operation symbols. It may be easier to think of an expression as a
              formula within a report. Expressions are edited using an Expression Editor which can be
              opened by clicking the ... button next to expression in the list.</li>

                    losing text. The field will increase in size based on its contents. This however has
                    implications for closely situated fields as they may be overwritten or overlap.<br>

  <blockquote>
      <p>
        Once a report is created to satisfaction, it can be saved by choosing <em>File &gt;
        Save</em>. A Report Properties dialog will appear:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Type a <strong>Name</strong> for the Report </li><br />
        <li> Choose the <strong>Report Type</strong>:
          <ul><br />
            <li><strong>Report</strong> or <strong>Label</strong> are separate report types for purely
              organizational purposes. Choosing <em>Label</em> will list the report under the Label
              heading on the reports side bar and choosing <em>Report</em> will list the report under
              the Report heading.
            </li><br />
            <li><strong>Invoice</strong> reports are listed under Reports in the reports side bar.
              These are typically created to capture an interaction such as Loan, Gift or Borrow.
              Reports created from a Loan query are made available when a Loan is saved by checking
              the 'Print Invoice on Save' box on the Loan form. </li><br />
          </ul>
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>Save For</strong> refers to level of access given to the report. Discipline will
          allow all collections within the Discipline access to the report and User will limit the
          access to the current User only. </li><br />
        <li> Choose a <strong>Repeats</strong> variable:
          <ul><br />
            <li><strong>Once</strong> will create one report/label.
            </li><br />
            <li><strong>Constant</strong> duplicates each record in the report/label and offers a
              number field for selecting the number of times for the repeat. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Saved reports can be opened from within SpecifyiReport to view and edit by choosing <em>File
        &gt; Open</em> and selecting either the label or report from the list. It is important to
        remember when editing a report that reports are created from Queries; therefore, new fields
        may not be added to a report that are not present in the query. Fields may be removed.
