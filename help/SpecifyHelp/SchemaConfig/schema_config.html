       Editing the Schema Configuration
    </h2>
    <p>
       Schema refers to the many tables and fields that systematize the many dimensions and
      relationships of the data within biological collections. The Schema Configuration module is a
      highly functional, though somewhat complex, set of tools created to configure the Specify
      schema for individual discipline needs. Changes made in the Schema Configuration tool will
      affect all collections within a discipline and can be used to individualize Specify for each
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
       Changes made within the Schema Configuration tool affect some very sensitive areas of the
      database and may require the Specify application to shut down. For this reason, all tabs must
      be closed before the tool will open, and when changes are saved within the Schema
      Configuration tool the Specify application will shut down. You
      will be prompted to save all changes within any open tabs before opening the Schema
      Configuration tool.    </p>
<p>
       The tools in the Schema Configuration provide the following functions:    </p>
    <ul><li>
      Change the captions, or display names, of tables and fields in Specify. These are displayed
      on forms and in searches. The names in the database are not editable, but the captions can
      be edited.      </li>
      <li>Hide unused tables or fields from the query tool. Hidden tables and fields will not be
      hidden on the forms. </li>
      <li>
        Edit descriptions (usage notes) for tables and fields. These can be viewed from within a
        form by double-clicking on the caption.      </li>
      <li>
        Create a format for a table. This allows one or more fields to represent a table in a
        search result. For example, an Agent is sometimes represented by the last name and first
        name fields, separated by a comma.      </li>
      <li>
        Create or edit an aggregatation for a table. A related table with a one-to-many
        relationship to the primary table combines records into a single record typically separated
        by semi colons.      </li>
      <li>
        Designate a field as being required. This is reflected on forms and in the WorkBench
        uploader. A record can not be saved unless all required fields containing data.      </li>
      <li>
        Format a field as a pick list, weblink or field format.      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Open Schema Configuration</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1. Close all tabs and save any changes before opening Schema Configuration (you will be
        prompted). Open Schema Configuration by clicking <em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>.
        The Schema Configuration tool (and menu) is only available to users in a Manager or
        Administrators group.    </p>

      <p> 2. In the resulting dialog choose <em>English</em> in the Available Locales. The 6.3  release of
        Specify has  been translated into Portugese. To use the Portugese version of Specify please contact Specify at <a href=
      "mailto:specify@ku.edu">specify@ku.edu</a>. Because the Specify
        project is Open Source, any third parties that are interested in translating Specify can
        easily do so, but are required to send the changes to the Specify project. If you are
        interested in translating Specify please contact the Specify Project at <a href=
      "mailto:specify@ku.edu">specify@ku.edu</a>.</p>
      <p><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Next, click the <em>Edit a Schema</em> button in the Tasks section of the dialog. Future
        releases of Specify will allow schemas to be both imported and exported. This would allow
        communities to share common schema configurations. A collection manager who has both the
        schema configuration and the forms changed to manage their discipline could share both with
        the entire community, allowing all Collection Managers to have the exact same set-up for
        their collection data.    </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
        The first tool is <em>Caption</em> and is available for both Tables and Fields. Simply
        select a table or field from the appropriate list and type the new name into the
        <em>Caption</em> field. The new caption will appear on forms, in the list of Query Creators
        and the Simple Search Configuration tool.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Only fields that are included on existing forms will reflect

          not remove fields from forms. Data can still be added to the forms in the hidden field and
          will be saved in the database. This tool is mainly used to simplify the lists presented for
          creating queries and simple searches by removing fields that are not used. The hidden tables
          and fields will not be removed from previously saved queries or reports.

        <p>
          Tables can be represented in search results and in reports by one or several fields within
          the table. Most tables are represented by only one field, (Collection Object shows the
          Catalog Number), but some are best represented by more than one field (Agent may be formatted
          to display Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial).
    </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that Preferred Taxon, Geography, Chronostratigraphy and
          Lithostratigraphy fields use the full name as their format. This is configured in the tree
          definition.

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              This type of format is useful when the data in one field sets a condition for another field.
              A good example is a Current Determination in Ichthyology. A Collection Object can have many
              Determinations, but only one can be marked as Current. Rather than displaying all
              Determinations the table can be formatted to display only the Current Determination.

        <p>
          Tables with a one-to-many relationship to the primary table could potentially link multiple
          records to the primary table. The only method of displaying these in a single line (e.g. for
          results or reports) is to aggregate them. Aggregating the related table will use the table
          format for each individual record and group them together into one record using a separator
          of your choosing. For example, a Collection Object can have many Preparations. The results of
          a query on Collection Objects containing any field in the Preparation table (for Collection
          objects with multiple Preparations) will return multiple rows for that Collection Object.
          However; selecting the aggregated and formatted table name in the query tool will return a
          single record with the Preparation information formatted and aggregated into a single string.

        Fields have several properties that tables do not.      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type</strong> indicates the type of field and is not user editable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Length</strong> indicates the length of the field. This can be useful to indicate
          how much text can be added to a particular string or text field. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong><a name="required_field" id="required_field"></a>Is Required</strong> refers to the required fields on forms. When entering data into
          a form with required fields the form changes can not be saved until all the required fields
          contain data. Any system required fields can not be edited. Other fields can be changed. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Field Format Type</strong> offers choices for altering string fields into either a
          Formatted (described below), <a href="../PickList/Pick_List.html">Pick List</a> or <a href=
      "../SchemaConfig/WebLinks.html">Web Link</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      </blockquote>
  <p>
    At this time User-Defined Pick Lists that are configured in the Schema Configuration also
    need to be added to individual forms by exporting the form set and editing the xml file for
    the form. Please refer to <a href="../PickList/Pick_List.html">User-Defined Pick List</a>.
    System Pick Lists are already included in the Specify forms and can be edited. Please refer
    to <a href="../PickList/system_picklist.html">System Pick Lists</a>.      </p>
  <p>
    Creating a Formatted Field and editing an existing System Pick List will immediately be
    reflected within other Specify modules, such as queries and forms which include the edited
    field.    </p>
  <p>
    New, or User Defined Pick Lists and Web Links will not be automatically reflected within the
    forms in Specify. The User Defined Pick List and Web Links must be configured in the Web
    Links or Pick List editors. Forms will then need to be exported, edited in XML to include the
    Pick List and Web Link, then imported back into Specify. Please refer to <a href=
      "../Import/import_export.html">Import/Export Forms</a> for more details.    </p>

            <u>Overview</u> </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Accession and Catalog Number formats are configured during the institution setup, but users
              may have other fields that require either a number scheme or a format. A format allows a
              field to include various data components, such as static text, a date or an incremented
              number. Gift Number and Loan Number often have a unique format within collections. These can
              be formatted in the Schema Configuration tool, which will change the format for the entire
              discipline. In other words, if a Gift Number is formatted in the schema configuration all the
              collections within the discipline will be required to use the new format, which will display
              on the Gift form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Catalog and Accession Numbers may not be edited in the Schema Configuration tool. At this
              time they may not be edited once they have been created. Field Formats that are created in
              the Schema Configuration tool may NOT be edited once data resides in the database.
            </p>
            <p>
              Field Formats can not be changed if data exists within the database in the format. In other
              words, before changing a field format all data using the old format must first be deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Field formatting functions are configured using the Format Type section at the bottom of the
              Schema Configuration tool.

        Choose a Type      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Numeric</strong> consists of numbers only and can be auto incremented by checking
          the 'Is Incrementer' box and using Auto Numbering when entering data. Specify will increment
          from the highest number present in the database. The length of the section can be set between
          1 and 10 characters. For formats which also include a year, the number can restart the count
          every year by clicking the <em>Restart counter every year</em> box. </li>
      
        <li> It is important to remember that field formats are implemented at a Discipline level and
          that formats that include a section that is incremented will include a numbering scheme that
          is shared by all Collections within the Discipline. </li>
        <li><strong>Alphanumeric</strong> can contain both characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em> and
          numbers. A field will appear which allows the section to be set between 1 and 10 characters
          in length. </li>
        <li><strong>Alpha</strong> may only be alphabetical characters <em>a</em> through <em>z</em>. A
          length field will appear which allows the section to be set between 1 and 10 characters in
          length. </li>
        <li><strong>Separator</strong> refers to a character that separates the various sections.
          Separator choices include - . / ' '(space) _ and are one character in length. </li>
        <li><strong>Year</strong> will add the year on the format. The current year will automatically
          be entered into this field on the form, but can be edited. </li>
        <li><strong>Any char(acter)</strong> allows any keyboard character. A field will appear which
          allows the length to be set between 1 and 10 characters. </li>
        <li><strong>Constant</strong> refers to any section that will remain constant and is not
          editable on a form. This section is useful for an institutional code. Type the characters for
          the constant in the field labeled <em>Text</em> located under the <em>Type</em> box. The
          length of the Constant section is only limited by the number of characters remaining in the
          50 character field length. </li>

      <p>3. Fill in the remaining information for the chosen section.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        7. Continue adding sections until the format is complete and displays correctly in the
        <em>Sample</em> window at the bottom of the editor.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> For data entry purposes, when manually entering a formatted
          number field, it is paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are
          available in a numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered.
          If only 1 is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results
          in searches, queries and reports.        </p>
