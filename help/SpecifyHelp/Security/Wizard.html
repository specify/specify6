      Specify Setup Wizard</h2>
  <p>The Specify Setup Wizard is required to customize and create a Specify database in MySQL. The Wizard walks you through the creation of a database including; the insertion of a schema in MySQL, and the initialization of the Specify database structure. The Specify Wizard also enables you to download authority files for Taxa (for some disciplines) and for Geography, as starting points for building and customizing your taxon and geography data. </p>
    <p>Before running the Specify 6.5 Setup Wizard, MySQL must have been previously installed on either the workstation on which Specify will be run, or on a shared network server computer for access from two or more workstations. User accounts must also exist within MySQL with the necessary permissions for Specify to communicate with MySQL. The creation of these accounts varies depending on your Specify setup. </p>
    <p><br />
  <strong>Standalone Specify installation on a workstation &ndash; not accessed by other workstations</strong> </p>
    
    <blockquote>
    <p>
      The documents <em>Installing MySQL on MacOS X for Specify</em> and <em>Installing MySQL on Windows for Specify</em> give step-by-step instructions for installing MySQL on both a Macintosh and Windows computer (respectively) and setting permissions for the MySQL &lsquo;root&rsquo; user account. The &lsquo;root&rsquo; user is referred to as the Specify &lsquo;IT User&rsquo; in Specify documentation. This account allows the Specify Wizard to access MySQL during the Specify setup process. You will need to enter the name &lsquo;root&rsquo; and the password to run the Wizard. </p>
    <p>
      Once the MySQL installation process is complete you may run the Specify Wizard. Step-by-Step instructions for running the Specify Wizard are included in the section of this document titled <a href="#mysql_username">&quot;Running the Specify Setup Wizard&quot;</a>. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The documents <em>Installing MySQL on MacOS X for Specify</em> and <em>Installing MySQL on Windows for Specify</em> give step-by-step instructions for installing MySQL on both a Macintosh and Windows computer (respectively) and setting permissions for the MySQL &lsquo;root&rsquo; user account. The &lsquo;root&rsquo; user is referred to as the &lsquo;Specify IT User&rsquo; in Specify documentation. This account allows the Specify Wizard to access MySQL during the Specify setup process. You will need to enter the name &lsquo;root&rsquo; and the password to run the Wizard. </p>
    <p>
      Two additional steps need to be completed to allow other workstations to access your Specify database before running the Specify Wizard: </p>
      <blockquote>
   <ol>
   <li>
      Edit your my.ini file on Windows, or your my.cnf on Linux and MacOS X, to include your local IP as the Bind-address.</li>
    <br />
     <li> Create a &lsquo;Master User&rsquo; within MySQL. The key points for creating this MySQL user are (1) to grant the necessary privileges on a designated Specify database and (2) to give the MySQL user account access to the database based on IP address range values.&nbsp; </li>
  </ol>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
      Instructions for these tasks can be found in the document <em>Setting up a Workstation as a Specify Database Server, </em>which is available on the specify website. </p>
    <p>Once these steps are complete, you may run the Specify Wizard to create a new database. Step-by-Step instructions for running the Specify Wizard are in the next section of this document. <br />
  When running the Specify Setup Wizard, in the first Wizard window enter &lsquo;root&rsquo; as the IT Username, and the password that you created. Then enter the dedicated database name chosen during the Master User creation, and the Hostname (network name of the computer running MySQL), then click on <em>Create Specify Database</em>.</p>
    <p>
  This will initiate the process of creating Specify&rsquo;s database tables and may take several minutes to complete.    </p>
    <blockquote>
  <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> if you click on the <em>Test IT</em> Login button, and if the login is successful, the Wizard will continue to the next screen. Before proceeding though, you must immediately use the <em>Back</em> button to return to the Database Information window, and click on the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button, otherwise your Specify database tables will not be created and the Specify Wizard will eventually fail. </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>In the subsequent Wizard window, which asks you for the Master account information, enter the master username and password that were created earlier in MySQL, and then click the<em>Test Master Login</em> button. This should return a message that your Master Login is correct, then you can proceed with the Wizard screens. If your Master account credentials do not allow you to login to the MySQL server, check your credentials for a misspelling. </p>
  <p>
  Do NOT click on the <em>Create Master User</em> button on this window, as that will re-create your Specify master user account with MySQL access permissions restricted only to the workstation on which you are running the Specify Wizard. This will prevent other workstations from accessing your Specify database.</p>
  <p>Step-by-Step instructions for running the Specify Wizard are included in the section of this document titled <a href="#mysql_username">&quot;Running the Specify Setup Wizard&quot;</a>. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>A dedicated MySQL server computer with access from multiple workstations</strong></p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <p>Two steps must be completed before running the Specify Wizard:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a Specify IT User in MySQL. This includes granting privileges on a named database and allowing access to the database based on IP address range values.</li><br />

      <li>Create a Specify Master User in MySQL. This includes granting privileges on a named database and allowing access to the database based on IP address range values.</li>
  </ol>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Specify requires access to MySQL through either a &lsquo;root&rsquo; account, or other user account, which has been granted all necessary permissions. Often, for shared MySQL servers managed for organizations, e.g. across departments or campuses for multiple databases (not just Specify), the root user account information is typically protected by database or network administrators and will not be available to complete the Specify database creation with the Specify Wizard. In those cases, the database or network administrator must first create two new users with specific privileges for a new database creation, and name the database -- before the Specify Wizard can be run. These user accounts and their passwords must be communicated to you, along with the name used for the database, before proceeding with the Specify Wizard. We provide simple MySQL scripts in the document <em>Setting Up Specify to Use a Networked MySQL Server</em>, available on the Specify Software web site, to enable MySQL server administrators to create the new users for a Specify database, and assign privileges to those users on a shared MySQL server computer. In documentation we refer to the root-level user for the Specify database as the &quot;Specify IT User&quot;. The other user is referred to as a &ldquo;Specify Master User&rdquo;. The Specify (thick) client application does not need to be installed on the MySQL server. The Specify Setup Wizard can be run from the server, but we recommend that it be operated on a networked workstation.</p>
    <p>
  When running the Specify Setup Wizard, in the first Wizard window enter the information for the new database: IT User name, IT User Password, Database name, and Hostname (network name of the computer running MySQL), then click on <em>Create Database</em>. </p>
    <p>
  This will initiate the process of creating Specify&rsquo;s database tables and may take several minutes to complete.    </p>
    <blockquote>
  <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> if you click on the <em>Test IT Login</em> button, and if the login is successful, the Wizard will continue to the next screen. Before proceeding though, you must immediately use the <em>Back</em> button to return to the Database Information window, and click on the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button, otherwise your Specify database tables will not be created and the Specify Wizard will eventually fail. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    In the subsequent Wizard window, which asks you for the Master account information, enter the master username and password that were created earlier in MySQL, and then click the <em>Test Master Login</em> button. This should return a message that your Master Login has worked and then you can proceed with the Wizard screens. If your Master account credentials do not allow you to login to the MySQL server, check your credentials for a misspelling. </p>
    <p>
    Do NOT click on the <em>Create Master User</em> button on this window, as that will re-create your Specify master user account with MySQL access permissions restricted only to the workstation on which you are running the Specify Wizard. This will prevent other workstations from accessing your Specify database.</p>
    <p>
      If Specify will be installed on a network server and run on several computers, the Setup Wizard should only be run once, from a single workstation, to setup the database on the network server. Do not re-run the Setup Wizard on other desktop computers when using a shared MySQL server. It creates a new, blank database and will permanently erase all existing data. Once the Wizard is run and completed on a single workstation to setup a Specify database, it is not needed again.</p>

      <p>The first window allows you to either create a Specify database or verify that Specify can access a database you have already created within MySQL. To create or verify a database, you must first complete the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>IT Username</strong> and <strong>IT Password</strong>
          must be an existing account with the necessary privileges
          in the MySQL database manager. This account will be used by
          the Specify Setup Wizard to create your Specify database and a
          Specify Master account (in the next window) in MySQL. If you
          do not know the IT administrator account username and
          password for MySQL, or do not have a MySQL installation, exit
          now. You can not go further without these. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Database Name</strong> will be used to name the
          database that the Setup Wizard is about to create. If you will be running Specify on a single workstation and will not grant access to the Specify database to other workstations, you are creating this name as you type it into the
          window. Once you name the database make sure to document it so
          you can reference it at a later date.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If you will be allowing other workstations to access your Specify database, a name has been previously identified for the database, and the IT/Master User have been given permission to access MySQL and create the database. You must type in the designated database name. If you have not identified a name for your database and granted the IT and/or Master User permission to access it, you may not proceed and must click <em>Cancel</em> to exit the Setup Wizard. More information about this step can be found in the introductory section of this help document.</p>
</blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Host Name</strong> is the name of the computer
          that is running MySQL. This is either an IP Address or name of
          the computer that is recognized by the server. When running
          MySQL on your local machine this is almost always 'localhost'
          or '127.0.0.1'.
          <blockquote>
            <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When using an IP Address
              make sure that the IP is 'static'. </p>

      <p>This window either creates the Master username and password for your Specify system, or verifies that a Master username and password that has already been created within MySQL is recognized by Specify. Any instance of Specify that allows access from other workstations must create the Master username and password using the MySQL Admin tool. More information about this step can be found in the introductory section of this help document.</p>
<p>The security system for Specify 6 uses both a &quot;Master&quot; username
        and password, and a User username and password. Specify uses the Master username and password to access the MySQL Database,
        and the User username and password to
        grant permission to run the Specify program. The Master account has SELECT, INSERT,
        UPDATE, DELETE and TABLE LOCK privileges on data tables in your
        Specify database only and has no other MySQL privileges. Specify
        uses only one Master username and password for all users, but
        encrypts the Master information with the User information, creating
        an encrypted string. This allows the Master information to
      become unique for each user.      </p>

          database. Once this account has been created you may not
          change the information on this screen, or any previous
          screens.</p>
        <p>When creating the Master username and password, the word
        &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Root&quot; SHOULD NOT BE USED. Please create a unique
        Master username and a secure, strong password for it. This
        should not be the same as the username and password used for the
        MySQL IT account in the previous window. This information should
        be remembered and secured by the person installing MySQL and
        Specify at your institution. The Specify administrator, (a role
        and account within Specify), will need the Master username and
        password to create new user accounts in Specify. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Advanced: Test the Master</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If you will be allowing other workstations to access your Specify database you must first create the Specify Master User in MySQL, grant it the necessary permissions and allow it access to the Specify database by setting an IP address range.

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Accessioning is the formal process by which a
        specimen or object is legally accepted and recorded as a museum
        item and differs from cataloging. Some museums and herbaria have
        a formal accessioning process, some do not. If your institution
        does not use the concept of accessions (typically handled by a
        registrar or administrative curator), then leave this item
        unchecked and simply click the <em>Next</em> button to proceed
        to the next window.</p>
      <p align="left">For organizations that do recognize accessions,
        the process usually entails documenting proof of ownership (in
        the form of a signed deed of gift), and that the material was
        legally acquired (in the form of all associated permits -
        collecting, import and export). An accession usually covers an
        entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be included
        within a single accession. For the institutions that use it,
        accessioning and its associated numbering system is usually set
        up as a standard museum-wide process, backed by policy. </p>
      <p align="left">The accession numbering scheme or sequence can
        either be recorded at an Institution level for all collections
        (Globally) or at a Division level. The way to do this within
        Specify is based on whether your institution has staff which
        manage all accession transactions for your institution, like a
        Registrar, or if accessions and accession numbers will be
        managed and assigned within one or more separate Divisions
        within the Institution. Again, if you do not use accessions,
        this choice can be ignored. Assigning accessions to be managed
        "globally" across the entire organization will ensure that
        accession numbers and records are unique across all collections
        for the entire institution.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you choose to
          manage your accessions globally you will be presented with the
          following window to choose a format. If you did not choose to
          manage your Accessions globally you will be presented with the

        Geography, (Specimen) Storage, Chronostratigraphy and
        Lithostratigraphy tables. Each tree is visually displayed as
        heirarchical levels. The Levels must first be defined in a tree
        definition, then nodes can be added. The Setup Wizard offers a
        table for each of the trees (Chronostratigraphy and
        Lithostratigraphy for paleo collections only) for creating tree
        definitions, or levels. These can also be edited at a later date
