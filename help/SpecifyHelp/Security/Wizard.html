       The Specify Wizard is used to create a new, empty database within Specify. It walks you
      through the creation of a database and insertion of a schema within MySQL, the creation of an
      administrative level database and Specify user and the initialization of the database
      structure. It also allows you to download that start of Taxon and Geography authority files.
    </p>
    <p>
       Before running the Wizard, Java and MySQL must be installed. MySQL must include an
      administrative (root) login account with all MySQL permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Setup Wizard should NOT be run if collection data already exists in Specify. It creates
      a new, blank database and will permanently erase all existing data. The Wizard should only be
      run one time, for the initial Specify installation and setup, then can be deleted from your
      computer.
    </p>
    <p>
       Fields that must contain data before moving to the next Wizard window (required fields) are
      displayed with a <strong>bold</strong> font.
    </p>
    <h4>
       MySQL requirements for creating a Specify database and Master credentials using the Specify
      Wizard
    </h4>
    <p>
       The first Wizard window creates a blank Specify database within MySQL and inserts the schema
      (empty tables, fields and relationships) for the database. The second Wizard window creates a
      Specify Master username and password. The Specify Wizard can <strong>NOT</strong> be used to
      perform these two tasks if:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The default data management engine for an existing MySQL installation is NOT InnoDB.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Specify Setup will be on a dedicated server, or desktop computer accessed by other
        desktops.
      </li>
      <li>
        You wish to create your own database rather than use the Wizard to create the Specify
        database and insert the schema.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       1. If your default MySQL engine is not InnoDB it can be changed using the guidelines found
      on the Specify website at <a href=
      "http://specifysoftware.org/content/changing-default-mysql-engine-innodb">http://specifysoftware.org/content/changing-default-mysql-engine-innodb</a>.
      If you are unable to change your default MySQL engine, you will need to create a blank
      Specify database with MySQL software tools and insert a Specify schema <em>before</em>
      running the Specify Setup Wizard. The Specify team provides both an explanation and script
      for performing these tasks from within MySQL on the Specify website at <a href=
      "http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql">http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The MySQL step-by-step installation guide available on the
      Specify web site, specifies to make INNOdb the default data storage engine when installing
      Specify for the first time. Institutions with legacy installations of MySQL may have had it
      configured originally for a different data engine, and in that case the Wizard should not be
      used to create a new Specify database in that installation of MYSQL, until after the above
      procedure and script is run.
    </p>
    <p>
       When you are running the Wizard, rather than creating the database and inserting the schema
      in the first Wizard window, you will verify that Specify can access your existing database
      and schema in the <em>Advanced</em> section by clicking on the <em>Test IT Login</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
       2. If the Specify database will be accessed by other 'client' computers you will first need
      to manually create a Specify Master username and password in MySQL before running the Specify
      Wizard. Instructions for setting up the Specify Master username and password in MySQL can be
      found on the Specify website at <a href=
      "http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup">http://specifysoftware.org/content/specify-system-setup</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       When running the Specify Wizard enter the MySQL information on the first Wizard screen and
      click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button to create the database and insert the
      schema. On the second Specify Wizard window enter the Specify Master credentials, then click
      the <em>Test Master Login</em> button to verify the Specify Master credentials were created
      from within MySQL.
    </p>
    <div style=" margin-left: 0;">
    </div>
    <p>
       3. If you wish to create your own Specify database from within MySQL rather than using the
      Specify Wizard the Specify team provides both an explanation and script for performing this
      task from within MySQL on the Specify website at <a href=
      "http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql">http://specifysoftware.org/content/creating-specify-database-within-mysql</a>.

       <span class="imgcaption">Enter MySQL IT Username and Password</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       This window allows you to either create a Specify database or verify that Specify can access
      a database you have already created within MySQL. To create or verify a database, you must
      first complete the following information:
    </p>
    <p>
       The <strong>IT Username</strong> and <strong>IT Password</strong> must be an account with
      full administrator privileges in the MySQL database manager. This account will be used by the
      Specify Setup Wizard to create your Specify database and a Specify Administrative User
      account (in the next window) in MySQL. If you do not know the IT administrator ("root")
      account username and password for MySQL, or do not have a MySQL installation, exit now. You
      can not go further without these.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <strong>Database Name</strong> will be used to name the database that the Setup Wizard
      is about to create. If you do not have an existing database but are using the Wizard to
      create one, you are creating this name as you type it into the window. Once you name the
      database make sure to document it so you can reference if you need it at a later date.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you have an existing database you much enter the name of the database in this text box so
      that the Wizard may verify that Specify can connect to the database before continuing with
      the Wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <strong>Host Name</strong> is the name of the computer that is running MySQL. This is
      either an IP Address or name recognized by name recognized by the network. When running MySQL
      on your local machine this is almost always 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note: When using an IP Address make sure that the IP is 'static'.
    </p>
    <p>
       <u><strong>Create a Specify Database</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
       When you click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button Specify will connect to MySQL
      using the information you have entered and then create your Specify database and insert the
      Specify schema. If Specify can not connect to MySQL and build the database for any reason a
      message will display. To proceed in the Wizard you will need to verify that the information
      entered and MySQL setup are correct.
    </p>
    <p>
       <u><strong>Verify access to an existing Specify Database</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
       Enter your database information in this window, then click the <em>Test IT Login</em> button
      in the Advanced section of the window. The Wizard will verify that Specify can connect to
      your existing database.

       <span class="imgcaption">Create a Master Username and Password</span>
    </p>
    <p>
       The security system for Specify 6 uses both a "Master" username and password, which Specify
      uses to access the MySQL Database, as well as a User username and password, which allows
      people to run the Specify program. The Master account has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
      privileges on data tables in your Specify database only and has no other MySQL privileges.
      Specify uses only one Master username and password for all users, but encrypts the Master
      password with the User information, creating an encrypted string. This allows the Master
      information to become unique for each user.
    </p>
    <p>
       This window either creates the Master Username and Password for your Specify system, or
      verifies that a Master username and password that has already been created within MySQL is
      recognized by Specify. Any instance of Specify that does not access MySQL on the local
      machine, (uses a remote server), must create the Master username and password using the MySQL
      Admin tool. This Master account must have SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges on
      data tables in your Specify database.
    </p>
    <p>
       When creating the Master username and password, the word "Master" or "Root" SHOULD NOT BE
      USED. Please create a unique Master username and a secure, strong password for it. This
      should not be the same as the Username and Password used for the MySQL IT account in the
      previous window. This information should be remembered and secured by the person installing
      MySQL and Specify at your institution. The Specify administrator (a role and account within
      Specify) will need the Master username and password to create new user accounts in Specify.
    </p>
    <p>
       Also, the "Master" username and password should not be used as a Specify user account name
      within Specify. Whichever user name and password you choose for the Master account, that
      username and password is never used to log in to Specify. This "Master" username and password
      should ALWAYS be unique. Do not use this username and password for any other accounts in
      MySQL or Specify.
    </p>
    <p>
       <u><strong>Create the Master</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
       When you click the <em>Create Master User</em> button Specify will take a moment to create
      the Master account in the database. Once this account has been created you may not change the
      information on this screen, or any previous screens; therefore, the <em>Back</em> button will
      become disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
       <u><strong>Test the Master</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
       Click the <em>Test Master Login</em> button to verify that Specify can connect to the
      Specify database using the existing master credentials that you have previously created in
      the MySQL command line tool.

    <p align="left">
       Specify Security refers to the set of permissions and entitlements within Specify which
      gives users the rights to see certain data and to use particular functions. If your Specify
      database will never have more than one user, then Security (i.e. permissions within Specify)
      can be turned off. This will give that user total access to all Specify program functions and
      data. Specify will not check the user type or the user's credentials within Specify to
      determine the level of database and component access that user will be given.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       If you will be creating multiple users within Specify it is recommended that you turn
      security on.

       This account is the first Specify user account for your database, and is created at the
      level of Manager, the highest rank in the Specify permission model. The account usually
      represents the primary user, or administrator, of your collection database and will also
      create an Administrator within Specify. It is this username and password that will be used to
      log in to Specify for the first time, once this setup Wizard is finished. At that time
      additional users can be added within Specify. Protect the username and make the password
      strong. This Specify manager level information will also be used to create a record in the
      Specify database for an ‘Agent’ representing the same person.

       The Specify data management levels mimic the common levels of hierarchy within institutions.
      Access to information and Specify tools are then set at the various levels both within the
      application and through the User Permissions.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       The Setup Wizard creates a single entry for each level of the hierarchy (Institution,
      Division, Discipline and Collection). This is the first step in that process. Each of the
      screens for creating these levels must be completed before the <em>Next</em> button will
      become enabled.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       The <strong>Name</strong> should be the formal name for your institution. It is a field
      within the Specify database, is displayed on the Institution form, it can be queried and used
      in reports.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       The <strong>Code</strong> is typically an acronym, codon, abbreviation or short name for
      your institution (not your collection), if you don't know of one, put in a placeholder, this
      can be edited at at a later date. Institution codes are often required for web services such
      as DiGIR.

       Choose Accession Level
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       Accessioning is the formal process by which a specimen or object is legally accepted and
      recorded as a museum item and differs from cataloging. Some museums and herbaria have a
      formal accessioning process, some do not. If your institution does not use the concept of
      accessions (typically handled by a registrar or administrative curator) then leave this item
      unchecked and simply click the <em>Next</em> button to proceed to the next window.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       For organizations that do recognize Accessions, the process usually entails documenting
      proof of ownership (in the form of a signed deed of gift) and that the material was legally
      acquired (in the form of all associated permits - collecting, import and export). An
      accession usually covers an entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be included
      within a single accession. For the institutions that use it, accessioning and its associated
      numbering system is usually set up as a standard museum-wide process, backed by policy.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       The accession numbering scheme or sequence can either be recorded at an Institution level
      for all collections (Globally) or at a Collection level. The way to do this within Specify is
      based on whether your institution has staff which manage all Accession transactions for your
      institution, like a Registrar, or if Accessions and accession numbers will be managed and
      assigned within one or more separate Divisions within the Institution. Again, if you do not
      use Accessions, this choice can be ignored. Assigning Accessions to be managed "globally"
      across the entire organization, will ensure that accession numbers and records are unique
      across all collections for the entire institution.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
       <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you choose to manage your Accessions globally you will be
      presented with the following window to choose a format. If you did not choose to manage your
      Accessions globally you will be presented with the window later in the Wizard process when
      you create a Collection.

       The Specify Wizard not only defines the Taxon tree but also allows loading of an authority
      file for Discipline. <span class="style2">Authority files were created using data from the
      </span>Catalog of Life Project for some of the disciplines within Specify. If this window
      does not appear there are no existing authority files for your chosen discipline.

      of taxon nodes and all associated data. Then, when adding Collection Objects into your
      database you can simply choose a taxa from the Taxon field rather than adding each
      individually as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
       Please note that loading the Taxon tree will also affect the tree definition. If you load
      the provided Taxon authority file for your discipline the accompanying tree definition may
      include ranks that were not defined by you in the previous window, but are necessary to
      include all the predefined Taxon information.

       Additional discipline-specific trees can be loaded from within Specify at the time new

       Click the <em>Choose</em> button for a list of taxon files for the discipline you are

       Create a Catalog Number Format
    </p>
    <p>
       Specify is able to accept data for collection objects or observations without assigning a
      Catalog Number. But when Catalog Numbers are used, they must be unique for each lot, specimen
      or observation. Many collections routinely assign catalog numbers to incoming specimens,
      perhaps as part of the accessioning process. These numbers may require a format with specific
      sections for data such as Institution Code and year or they may simply use an incrementing
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
       Catalog Numbers can either be unique to each Collection, shared by several or be used
      throughout the Institution. The Catalog Number chosen at this time will not affect where it
      is used relative to other Collections, this will be configured from within the Specify
      application. The Catalog Number format for this collection can not be edited once it is
      chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
       Several formats are also available within this drop-down menu list:
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>CatalogNumber</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear automatically in the first
      section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited. The '###' section of the
      format is a number that is six digits in length and automatically incremented when Auto
      Numbering is turned on in Specify and manually entered when Auto Numbering is turned off.
      These two sections are separated by a dash.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>CatalogNumberAlphaNumByYear</strong> (2009-######) The year will appear
      automatically in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited. The
      '###' section of the format is a number that is six digits in length and automatically
      incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify and manually entered when Auto
      Numbering is turned off. These two sections are separated by a dash.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>CatalogNumberNumeric</strong> (#########) This is a nine digit number that is
      automatically incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify and manually entered
      when Auto Numbering is turned off.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>CatalogNumberString</strong> (XXXXXXXXXX) This is a ten digit string that can
