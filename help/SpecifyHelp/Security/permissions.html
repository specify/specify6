       Adding Users and Setting Permissions
    </h2>
    <p>
       Specify includes a highly flexible Security module that allows a system administrator to add
      users, then limit their operations within, and access to, the various tables and tools within
      Specify. These essentially constitute the User Permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
       To access the Security tool click <em>System &gt; System Setup &gt; Security Tools</em>.
      Security tools are only available to users in a Manager or Administrator group.
    </p>
    <p>
       Users are added to Specify based on their Institutional Level and User Group.    </p>
    <p>Security can be turned on or turned off. An icon at the bottom right of the status bar alerts users as to the status of security. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img src="../../images/security_on_20.png" width="20" height="20" />	Security is ON</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/security_off_20.png" width="20" height="20" /> Security is OFF</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;
       
    </p>
    <h3>
       Institutional Levels
    </h3>
    <p>
       Specify mirrors the common levels of hierarchy within institutions. This hierarchy is viewed
      in an Institution Tree on the left side of the Security window.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Institution
      </li>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
       
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Discipline
              </li>
              <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Collection
                  </li>
                  <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Users
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>
       At this time users are added at the Collection level only. The lowest level, collection, can
      access data within a specific collection (Wet Collection, Teaching Collection). Specify opens
      in a collection, or at a collection level (in a multi-collection database); therefore users
      added to only one collection can not access other collections.
    </p>
    <p>
       Users can belong to more than one collection.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;

        <u>Adding Institutional Levels        </u></h4>
      <p>
        If the desired Institutional level is not present in the Institution Tree it can be added in
        the System Configuration module by choosing <em>System &gt; Collection Setup &gt;
        Configuration</em> and following the instructions for <a href=
      "../Configuration/institution_hierarchy.html">Adding Institutional Levels</a>.

    <h3>
       User Groups
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Specify adds users within an existing user group. The groups are editable and can be
        established according to levels of access to data and tools within Specify per institution.
        Each group has a set of default privileges. Users entered into the group acquire the default
        privileges of that group. The user privileges can then be edited based on the exact
        privileges the individual user will require.    </p>
      <p>User groups also have their own system of levels:</p>
      <p>
        The default permissions in Specify include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Guest</strong> users can view the data within a collection and use the WorkBench,
          but may not Upload data from the WorkBench into the Specify database.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Limited Access</strong> users are granted full access to all data and tools except
          Backup and Restore, Schema Configuration, Resource Import/Export, Configuration, WorkBench
          Schema Configuration and Security. </li>
        <li><strong>Full Access</strong> users are granted full access to all data and tools except
          Backup and Restore, Schema Configuration, Resource Import/Export, Configuration, WorkBench
          Schema Configuration and Security. </li>
        <li><strong>Managers</strong> have full permissions to all data and tools within Specify. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users can be added to different groups within different Collections. For example, user A could be added at a Managers level for collection A but at a Limited Access level in collection B.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Administrator group also exists outside the Institutional Hierarchy. An Administrator is
        automatically given full access to all data and tools inside Specify. Administrators are the
        only users with access to the Backup and Restore, Schema Configuration, Resource
        Import/Export, Configuration, WorkBench Schema Configuration and Security tools. At this time
        an Administrator must also belong to a collection inside the Institutional Hierarchy for the
        purpose of opening Specify to a collection and creating an associated Agent in that
        collection. If Specify was originally configured by running the Specify Setup Wizard the
        original user was placed in both the Administrator group and Manager group in the collection
        that was created by the Wizard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buttons for adding and deleting users are found on the bottom left of the work space
        under the institution tree.      </p>

        Click the desired group (within the desired collection), then click the Add a New User to
        the Group. The Specify User form will pop-up for user information to be entered.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong> refers to the username the user will use to login to Specify. Once
          the username is saved it may not be edited.      </li>
        <li><strong>Password</strong> is the password the user will use to login to Specify. Passwords
          can be edited at a later date either in Security Tools or by choosing <em>Help &gt; Change
            Password</em>. Users should choose strong passwords with varying characters and
          capitalization. A strength bar exists for judging the quality of the entered password. </li>
        <li><strong>Password Strength</strong> offers checkboxes with the best suggestions for a strong password. The Password Minimum Length is the only password strength item that is enforced. The default length is eight (8) characters, but can be changed using the <a href="../Configuration/institution_hierarchy.html#edit_institution">Institution form.</a></li>
        <li><strong>Master Key</strong> refers to the encrypted Master Username and Password. Simply fill in
          all the information within the form and click the <em>Generate New Key</em> button. The
          key can not be created without the Name and Password information. The key is stored locally
          and will therefore need to be given to the user and entered by the user at the time of
          their first login to Specify.      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once the user information has been entered a dialog will appear asking if you wish to search for an Agent or create a new Agent. All users in Specify must also be Agents within a collection. If you think a user may already exist as an Agent click on the <em>Search</em> button. If you know the new user is not a current Agent in the database click the <em>Create</em> button.</p>
      <p>If you chose to search for an agent a form will appear entering search information.</p>
      <p>If you chose to create an agent a form will appear to add an agent.</p>

       <u>Setting User Permissions    </u></h4>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Specify 6.0 grants default permissions to each User Group within Specify when security is
              turned on. These permissions are then passed down to each User within the Group. The
              permissions for the individual user can either be left unchanged and therefore remain exactly
              like the Group, or be edited for that user. When editing permissions for individual users
              permissions for tables and tools can be added, but not removed. In other words, permissions
              inherited from the Group can not be edited. To change these permissions the Group itself must
              be edited.

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Permissions can be removed and added at the Group level, but keep in mind that Specify will
              update all the Users in the group with the changed permissions. Changing permissions for a
              Group will only affect that Group's collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specify limits the Backup and Restore, Schema Configuration, Resource Import/Export,
              Configuration, WorkBench Schema Configuration and Security tools to Administrators only, but
              permissions for all other data and tools are configurable per Group and per User.

          </blockquote>
          <h4>
    <u>How Permissions affect the Specify Application</u>    </h4>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              When Specify starts up, it checks the user permissions and loads various Specify tools
              accordingly. Therefore, users that are not given permission to use modules in Specify will
              not see the corresponding buttons that connect users to that module. For instance, users that
              are not given permission to view trees will not have a tree button on the task bar or have
              the ability to add the tree button in the user preferences tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, users that are not given permission to delete or add data will not see the add or
              delete buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a user has questions about their permissions they can view it by clicking <em>System &gt;
              System Setup &gt; Security Summary</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is extremely important to note that even though permissions are listed separately for
              each table and tool, many of these work in unison and should have similar settings. For
              instance, for a user to have access to a Collection Object form for data entry purposes the
              user will need to have View, Add and possibly Modify privileges for ALL the tables on the
              Collection Object form (Collection Object, Determinations, Collecting Event, Taxon,
              Preparations, Collection Object Attribute, Collectors and Collection Object Attachments) IN
              ADDITION to the Form tool itself. For instance, in this example if permission was not given
              for a user to Add or Modify the Preparations table the user would not be provided with the
              <img width="16" height="16" src="../../images/add.png">&nbsp;(add) or <img width="16" height=
      "16" src="../../images/delete.png">&nbsp;(delete) button on the Preparations sub form within
              the Collection Object form. For this reason a good practice may be to set the same level of
              permissions for all the Tables within a tool with the same level of permissions being set for
              the Tool itself. </p>
            <p>
              A good approach to setting permissions may be to decide what Tables and Tools a particular
              user should not have access to and then change the permissions accordingly.
            </p>
