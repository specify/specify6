<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Specify EZDB! You have unpacked the power of Specify without the installation and maintenance requirement of MySQL. Specify EZDB includes embedded MySQL engine, and is intended for use by a single collection on a single workstation. If your project requires multiple collections then you will need to install the full version of Specify.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Specify EZDB can also be used to evaluate Specify. If you are using it for this purpose, please contact the <a href=
      "mailto:specify@ku.edu">Specify team</a>. They can provide you with a test database and the instructions needed to download and install it. </p>
  <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you are using a test database to evaluate Specify and have received a test database, DO NOT run the Specify EZDB Setup Wizard.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> A compatibility issue exists with Windows 7. If you are running Specify EZDB with Windows 7 you must run SpecifyEZDB in Compatibility Mode. This can be accomplished by right-clicking on the SpecifyEZDB.exe file in Windows 7 and choosing: <em>Troubleshoot Compatibility &gt; Try Recommended Settings</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Specify EZDB Setup Wizard is required to customize the necessary components in the embedded MySQL for  Specify EZDB. It walks you through the creation of a database including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Insertion of a schema within MySQL.</li><br />
  <li>Creation of an administrative level  Specify user.</li><br />
  <li>Initialization of the database structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also allows you to download  Taxon (optional) and Geography authority files.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Java SE Run-time Environment, i.e. JRE 1.6 (=6.0) or later must be installed on the workstation that will run Specify EZDB.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first window allows you to  create your Specify database or verify that Specify can access a database you have installed. To create or verify a database, you must first complete the following information:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Type in an  <strong>IT Username</strong> and <strong>IT Password</strong>. This will create an account with full administrator privileges within the embedded  MySQL database manager. This account will be used by the Specify Setup Wizard to create your Specify database and a Specify Master account (in the next window) in MySQL. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Please make a note of the IT username and password. Other EZDB Tools associated with Specify EZDB require this IT username and password to run.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The <strong>Database Name</strong> is pre-filled  with 'Specify' but can be changed by typing in a new name into the text box. Document the database name 
    used to log in. Once the Wizard is complete, be sure to make a note of the name. </p>
    <p>The <strong>Host Name</strong> refers to the computer that you are using. Because you are only accessing the embedded MySQL on your local machine this should remain as 'localhost'.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><u>Create a Specify Database</u></p>
    <p>When you click the <em>Create Specify Database</em> button Specify will connect to MySQL using the information you have entered and then create your Specify database and insert the Specify schema. </p>
    <p><u>Advanced: Test IT Login</u></p>
    <p>Use this button to verify that  Specify EZDB can access a database that you have installed.</p>

<p align="center"><span class="imgcaption">Create a Master Username and Password</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The security system for Specify 6 uses both a &quot;Master&quot; username and password, which Specify uses to access  the MySQL Database, as well as a User username and password, which allows a user to run the Specify program. The Master account has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,  DELETE and TABLE LOCK privileges on data tables in your Specify database only and has no other MySQL privileges. Specify uses only one Master username and password for all users, but encrypts the Master password with the User information, creating an encrypted string. This allows the Master information to become unique for each user. </p>
  <p>Specify EZDB uses the same Master username and password as the IT username and password in the first EZDB Wizard window. The username and password are filled-in for you and can not be changed.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Create the Master</strong></p>
    <p>When you click the <em>Create Master User</em> button, Specify will take a moment to create the Master account in the database. Once this account has been created you may not change the information on this screen, or  any previous screens.</p>
    <p><strong>Advanced: Test the Master</strong></p>

  <p align="left">Specify Security refers to the set of permissions and entitlements within Specify which gives users the rights to see certain data and to use particular functions. If your Specify database will never have more than one user, (you), then Security (i.e. permissions within Specify), can be turned off. This will give you total access to all Specify program functions and data. Specify will not check your credentials or limit your access to data or Specify components.</p>
  <p align="left">It is not recommend that Specify EZDB be used with multiple users; therefore Security can be turned off. However, if you are using Specify EZDB 
  to evaluate Specify and wish to evaluate security also, then simply check the box to turn security on. Security can also be turned on inside the Specify 
  EZDB application.</p>

  <p>This account is the first Specify user account for your database, and it is created at the level of Manager, the highest  level in the  Specify permission model. The account usually represents the primary user, or administrator, of your collection database. An Administrator account will also be created within Specify using this information.    It is this username and password that will be used to log in to Specify for the first time, once the EZDB Setup Wizard is finished. At that time additional users can be added within Specify. </p>
  <p>Protect the username and make the password strong. This Specify manager level information will also be used to create a record in the Specify database for an &lsquo;Agent&rsquo; representing the same person. </p>

<p align="center" class="imgcaption">Choose Accession Level</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Accessioning is the formal process by which a specimen or object is legally accepted and recorded as a museum item and differs from cataloging.  Some museums and herbaria have a formal accessioning process, some do not. If your institution does not use the concept of accessions (typically handled by a registrar or administrative curator), then leave this item unchecked and simply click the <em>Next</em> button to proceed to the next window.</p>
  <p align="left">For organizations that do recognize accessions, the process usually entails documenting  proof of ownership (in the form of a signed deed of gift), and that the material was legally acquired (in the form of all associated permits - collecting, import and export). An accession usually covers an entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be included within a single accession.  For the institutions that use it, accessioning and its associated numbering system is usually set up as a standard museum-wide process, backed by policy.  </p>
  <p align="left">The accession numbering scheme or sequence can either be recorded  at an Institution level for all collections (Globally) or at a Division level. Since it is recommended that Specify EZDB be used with a single collection this is typically managed globally. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you choose to manage your accessions globally, you will be presented with the following window to choose a format. If you did not choose to manage your Accessions globally you will be presented with the window later in the Wizard process when you create a Collection.</p>

Each tree, visually displayed as heirarchical nodes, is backed up by a tree definition, listing all levels and allowing customization of these levels. The Levels must first be defined, then nodes can be added. The Setup Wizard offers a table  for each of the trees (Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy for paleo collections only) for creating  tree definitions, or levels. These can also be edited at a later date from within Specify. </p>
  <p align="left">Nodes for the Storage tree can be added within the Specify application. The storage tree operates at the Institution level and is available and visible to all Collections, therefore, it is important to include the necessary levels for all collection.</p>
