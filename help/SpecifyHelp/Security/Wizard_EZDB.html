    <p>
       Welcome to Specify EZDB! You have unpacked the power of Specify without the installation and
      maintenance requirement of MySQL. Specify EZDB includes embedded MySQL engine, and is
      intended for use by a single collection on a single workstation. If your project requires
      multiple collections then you will need to install the full version of Specify.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Specify EZDB can also be used to evaluate Specify. If you
        are using it for this purpose, please contact the Specify team at
        <strong>support@specifysoftware.org</strong>. They can provide you with a test database and the
        instructions needed to download and install it.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you are using a test database to evaluate Specify and
        have received a test database, DO NOT run the Specify EZDB Setup Wizard.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> A compatibility issue exists with Windows 7. If you are
        running Specify EZDB with Windows 7 you must run SpecifyEZDB in Compatibility Mode. This
        can be accomplished by right-clicking on the SpecifyEZDB.exe file in Windows 7 and
        choosing: <em>Troubleshoot Compatibility &gt; Try Recommended Settings</em>.
      </p>

    <p>
       The Specify EZDB Setup Wizard is required to customize the necessary components in the
      embedded MySQL for Specify EZDB. It walks you through the creation of a database including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Insertion of a schema within MySQL.
      </li>
      <li style=" list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none;">
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Creation of an administrative level Specify user.
      </li>
      <li style=" list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none;">
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Initialization of the database structure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       It also allows you to download Taxon (optional) and Geography authority files.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Java SE Run-time Environment, i.e. JRE 1.7 (=7.0) or later
        must be installed on the workstation that will run Specify EZDB.

         The first window allows you to create your Specify database or verify that Specify can
        access a database you have installed. To create or verify a database, you must first
        complete the following information:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
           Type in values for an <strong>IT Username</strong> and <strong>IT Password</strong>.
          This does not exist but rather will be created when you click on the <em>Next</em> button
          on this window. This account will be created with full administrator privileges within
          the embedded MySQL database manager. This account will be used by the Specify Setup
          Wizard to create your Specify database and a Specify Master account (in the next window)
          in MySQL.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
             <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Please make a note of the IT username and password.
            Other EZDB Tools associated with Specify EZDB require this IT username and password to
            run.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
           The <strong>Database Name</strong> is pre-filled with 'Specify' but can be changed by
          typing in a new name into the text box. Document the database name used to login. Once
          the Wizard is complete, be sure to make a note of the name.
        </p>
        <p>
           The <strong>Host Name</strong> refers to the computer that you are using. Because you
          are only accessing the embedded MySQL on your local machine this should remain as
          'localhost'.

      <p>
         The security system for Specify 6 uses both a "Master" username and password, which
        Specify uses to access the MySQL Database, as well as a User username and password, which
        allows a user to run the Specify program. The Master account has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
        DELETE and TABLE LOCK privileges on data tables in your Specify database only and has no
        other MySQL privileges. Specify uses only one Master username and password for all users,
        but encrypts the Master password with the User information, creating an encrypted string.
        This allows the Master information to become unique for each user.
      </p>
      <p>
         Specify EZDB uses the same Master username and password as the IT username and password in
        the first EZDB Wizard window. The username and password are filled-in for you and can not
        be changed.

        functions and data. Specify will not check your credentials or limit your access to data or
        Specify components.

         It is not recommend that Specify EZDB be used with multiple users; therefore Security can

      <p align="left">
         Accessioning is the formal process by which a specimen or object is legally accepted and
        recorded as a museum item and differs from cataloging. Some museums and herbaria have a
        formal accessioning process, some do not. If your institution does not use the concept of
        accessions (typically handled by a registrar or administrative curator), then leave this
        item unchecked and simply click the <em>Next</em> button to proceed to the next window.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
         For organizations that do recognize accessions, the process usually entails documenting
        proof of ownership (in the form of a signed deed of gift), and that the material was
        legally acquired (in the form of all associated permits - collecting, import and export).
        An accession usually covers an entire field trip and multiple catalog items could be
        included within a single accession. For the institutions that use it, accessioning and its
        associated numbering system is usually set up as a standard museum-wide process, backed by
        policy.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
         The accession numbering scheme or sequence can either be recorded at an Institution level
        for all collections (Globally) or at a Division level. Since it is recommended that Specify
        EZDB be used with a single collection this is typically managed globally.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left">
           <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you choose to manage your accessions globally, you
          will be presented with the following window to choose a format. If you did not choose to
          manage your Accessions globally you will be presented with the window later in the Wizard
          process when you create a Collection.

         Please note that loading the Taxon tree will also affect the tree definition. If you load
        the provided Taxon authority file for your discipline, the accompanying tree definition may

      <p>
         Specify is able to accept data for collection objects or observations without assigning a
        Catalog Number. But when Catalog Numbers are used, they must be unique for each lot,
        specimen or observation. Most collections routinely assign catalog numbers to incoming
        materials, perhaps as part of the accessioning process. These numbers may require a format
        with specific sections for data such as Institution Code and year or they may simply use an
        incrementing number.
      </p>
      <p>
         Catalog Numbers can either be unique to each Collection, shared by several collections or
        be used throughout the Institution. The Catalog Number chosen at this time will not affect
        where it is used relative to other collections, this will be configured from within the
        Specify application. The Catalog Number format for this collection can not be edited once
        it is chosen.

         Collections that do not use one specific format for their Catalog Number may wish to
        choose CatalogNumberString from the list, this will allow any format to be entered as long
        as they are all of the character length chosen.

         Accession Numbers may require a format or may simply use a number. Choose <em>None</em> to
        leave the Accession Number as a text field on the Accession form. Accession Number formats
        are not editable once data has been entered in the database.

            <p align="left">
               <strong>Create</strong> allows you to create your own format. Choosing Create will
              open the Field Formatting Editor. Click <a href=

               <strong>Accession Number</strong> (2009-AA-###) The year will appear automatically
              in the first section (2009) of the format, and can also be manually edited. The 'AA'
              section of the format is alphanumeric and accepts both characters <em>a</em> through
              <em>z</em> and numbers. The ### section of the format is a number that is
              automatically incremented when Auto Numbering is turned on in Specify and manually
              entered when Auto Numbering is turned off. This format offers two alphanumeric
              characters and three incremented numbers.
