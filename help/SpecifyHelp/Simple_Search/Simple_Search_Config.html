<h2><strong>Configure Simple Search </strong></h2>
<p>Simple Search can be configured to use the minimum number of fields needed for a search, which will produce faster results.</p>
<p>Simple Search can also be configured to show results from indexed fields in other  tables, or <em>Related Searches</em>. For example; a search for an Agent name can display the name in the Agent table, as well as all Determinations owned by that agent in the Determinations table. At this time the Related Searches are already built into Specify and can only be activated or deactivated. </p>
<p>Click the <img src="../../images/Down16x16.png" alt="down" width="16" height="16" /> (down arrow) button in the Search box and choose <img src="../../images/System32x32.png" width="20" height="20" /><em>Simple Search Con</em><em>fig</em> from the drop-down-menu to open the Simple Search Configuration dialog. </p>
<p>The Simple Search Configuration dialog houses three separate tools; Search Fields, Related Searches and Results Ordering. All are accessible through tabs a the top of the dialog window.</p>
<p><u><strong><a name="search_fields" id="search_fields"></a>Search Fields</strong></u> enables  fields within tables to be selected or deselected for both searches and display results. The Search Fields tool is divided into 4 sections.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Available Tables</strong> provides a list of available tables for Simple Search.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Search Fields</strong> lists the fields in the chosen table that are available to be included in the search. Choose fields by checking the box. Uncheck the box to remove the field from the search. Sorting determines whether the selected field will be sorted in results. Available options are Ascending, Descending or None (default). The ordering of fields may have a bearing on the sort order if more than one field is selected to be sorted.</li><br>
  <li>Click the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" alt="up" width="16" height="16" />, and <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" alt="down" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder keys) to move a selected field up or down in the ordered list.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Display Fields</strong> lists other fields in the chosen table that are available to be included as part of the Simple Search results, but are not  searchable.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Fields To Be Searched</strong> provides a full list of the fields to be included, (and their associated table icon), in the Simple Search. This list will update as new fields and tables are chosen. To remove an entire table from the list, all fields must be deselected in the Search Fields section of the editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><a name="related_searches" id="related_searches"></a>Related Searches</u></strong> enables various fields that are related to the  Search Fields  to be selected as part of the search configuration. The Related Searches tool is divided into 3 sections.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Related Searches</strong> lists the related tables available for Simple Search. </li><br />
  <li>Check or uncheck the <strong>Activate</strong> check box to add/remove the table to the Simple Search configuration.</li><br />
  <li>A <strong>Description</strong> text box gives a description of the relationships between the related primary tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>For optimal Simple Search performance, configure Simple Search to search only the fields that are needed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="results_ordering" id="results_ordering"></a>Results Ordering </strong>allows the  primary and related tables  to be ordered.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a Search field.</li><br />
  <li>Click the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> or <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> arrow to move the selected table up or down the order for the Simple Search results page.</li>
</ul>
