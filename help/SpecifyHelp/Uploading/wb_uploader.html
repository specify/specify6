      WorkBench Uploader</h2>
    <p>The WorkBench is both a stand-alone tool and an integrate part of
      the Specify platform. The Upload function is only available in the
      Specify WorkBench, not the stand alone WorkBench. Data sets
      created using the stand-alone version will need to be exported and
      reimported into the (embedded) Specify 6 WorkBench for uploading.
      The current version of the stand-alone WorkBench is not able to
      export data sets along with their mapping information; therefore,
      data imported into the embedded Specify WorkBench from the
      stand-alone WorkBench will need to be remapped.</p>
    <p>Data sets in the Specify WorkBench can be uploaded into Specify 6
      with the Uploader tool. This makes the uploader a fast and easy
      way to transfer data from an MS Excel or CSV file into Specify by
      first <a href="../Workbench/ImportData.html">importing</a> the
      data into the WorkBench. </p>
    <p>When a data set is uploaded a record set in Specify will be
      created using the main table. The record set will be named using
      the name of the data set as well as the date of the upload.</p>
    <p>Guest users are not allowed access to the Upload tool in the
      default Specify permissions.</p>
    <p>Before uploading the data set, please note the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the data set mapping and verify that data set fields are
        being mapped to the correct fields in Specify 6. When importing
        MS Excel and CSV files the automapping does not always find the
        correct fields (especially when using latitude 1, Genus, Species
        and Author fields) and may require some remapping.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Check existing data in Specify to verify that data being
        uploaded will not add a duplicate record because of a typo or
        abbreviation. One example is Geography. If you have run the
        Specify Setup Wizard and uploaded the Geography data the United
        States exists within the Geography table (and tree) as 'United
        States'. If your data set includes the United States as anything
        other than 'United States' (for example, 'US' or 'USA') the
        Upload function will create a new Geography record (and node on
        the Geography tree). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Columns in imported files that do not map to a specific
        Specify field should be mapped to an existing Text or Number
        field. These fields will then need to be renamed accordingly
        within Specify to display correctly on forms and become
        searchable in queries. This can be accomplished by changing the
        field caption in the <a
          href="../SchemaConfig/schema_config.html#change_caption">Schema




          Configuration tool</a>. These fields can also be renamed for
        use in future mappings using the WorkBench Schema Configuration
        tool</li>
      <br>
      <li>The data set must have data in fields that are required by
        Specify 6. For example, if a data set column is mapped to a
        Taxon field in Specify, all <strong>required</strong> Taxon
        fields, including <strong>enforced</strong> ranks, must be
        mapped and include data in the data set.</li>
      <br>
      <li>At this time the Uploader does not update or change data in
        existing records, it only adds new records. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Any Specify tabs that allow data to be written to the database
        must be closed when uploading from the WorkBench. In other
        words, while uploading no user in the Collection can edit Forms,
        Trees, Tree Definitions, System Configuration or the Schema
        Configuration. Specify will automatically close any open tabs
        after prompting the users.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In a multi-collection database the WorkBench is unable to
        verify the data sets for an appropriate collection. It is up to
        the user to ensure that the data set is being uploaded to the
        correct Collection.</li>
      <br>
      <li>&nbsp;Attachment can be associated with the following tables:</li>
      <br>
      <blockquote> Accession <br>
        Agent <br>
        Borrow <br>
        Collecting Event <br>
        Collection Object <br>
        Conservation Description <br>
        Conservation Event <br>

        Reference Work <br>
        Repository <br>
        Taxon <br>
        <br>
      </blockquote>
      <li>If none of these tables are present in the mapping file for
        the data set an error message will display informing the user
        that the image can not be uploaded. Any images not attached to a
        table in the WorkBench (at the time they are added) will be
        attached to the 'main' table that is present in the data set
        mapping. The uploader will look for main tables in this order:
        Collection Object, Accession, Taxon, Collecting Event and then
        Locality.When more than one of the attachment tables is present
        in the data set a dialog will display to choose which table to
        associate with the attachment file.<br>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>The WorkBench has a limit of 4000 records that can be uploaded
        at one time. MS Excel files that include more than 4000 records
        can be separated using the <a href="../Uploading/splitter.html">Specify




          File Slicer</a> application that ships with Specify. </li>

    <h3><a name="uploader_validate" id="uploader_validate"></a>Validate
      Data</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The validation tool compares the data in the data set to the
        required fields and field formats of the Specify fields to which
        they are mapped. It then indicates which cells violate
        requirements, don't match formats, or will create new data in
        taxon, geography and agent tables. </p>
      <p>When a dataset is opened the validation panel is not
        automatically displayed. Simply click the <img
          src="../../images/validate_workbench_20.png" alt="validate"
          height="20" width="20"> (validation) icon to show or hide the
        panel.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../../images/validation_screen.png"
          alt="validation screen"></p>
      <p class="imgcaption" align="center">Validation Panel</p>
      <p>Check the <em><strong> Highlight Invalid Cells</strong></em>
        to turn the validation off and on. This type of validation
        compares the values in each cell of the WorkBench with the
        values in Specify fields and highlights cells that contain
        invalid values in <span class="style1">red</span>. The number
        of invalid cells will be shown in the validation panel. </p>
      <p>A tooltip is available within each cell that offers information
        about the invalid value. Simply hold the mouse over the invalid
        cell for the tooltip to appear. An example of an invalid value
        may be a date in an incorrect format or one that does not match
        the predetermined terms in a Specify Pick List. A more complete
        list of invalid values is offered in the <a
          href="#upload_requirement">Data Set Requirement</a> section of
        this document.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The validation tool can only
          check one level of hierarchical fields per validation. Column
          headings that are mapped to trees will be validated from the
          top of the tree structure. For example, in the Geography tree
          the validation tool will check the Continent field, then
          Country, then State, then County and finally City (your
          geography tree may have a different structure). If your data
          set contains new data in both country and state cells the
          validation tool will only alert you to the new data in the
          Country cells.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The validate function will
          not clean up or detect bad (misspelled or incorrect) data. For
          example, it will upload any entry for 'genus' even if the data
          includes both genus and species information, is not a valid
          name or is misspelt. These should however be highlighted as
          new data in yellow (see below). The user is responsible for
          establishing that the data is clean and correct. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And / Or</p>
      <p>Check the <em><strong>Hightlight New Records</strong></em> to
        turn the validation on and off. This type of validation compares
        the data in each cell of the WorkBench with the data in Specify
        fields and highlights cells that contain new data in <span
          class="style5">orange</span>. These cells should be checked
        for spelling and other errors as this may be the only reason
        these are being highlighted. The number of new data cells will
        be shown in the validation panel. </p>
      <p>An <span class="style4">blue</span> highlight indicates that
        multiple matches have been found in the database e.g. if there
        is a Fred Smith and Jack Smith in the database and you have
        Smith mapped to an Agent last name field with no first name the
        validation tool will not know whether Smith should be matched to
        Fred or Jack, or be a new Agent. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The WorkBench does not
          compare the cells within the WorkBench. Therefore, there may
          be times when multiple instances of the same new data occur in
          the dataset, but the validation tool will count and display
          each cell as containing new data. For instance; if the county
          <em>Douglas</em> is not included in the Geography tree within
          Specify but is included in 36 data set records, the validation
          tool will display the information: <em>36 New Cells</em>,
          even though <em>Douglas</em> is only one new term. </p>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Validating new cells in large
          data sets can take some time. If it is necessary to cancel the
          Highlight New Cells function during a validation simply double
          click on the status bar. </p>

    <h3><strong>Upload a Data Set</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a data set in the Specify 6 WorkBench. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Click the <img src="../../images/upload_data_20x20.gif"
          height="20" width="20">(Upload) button found in the Workspace
        Item Bar. The WorkSpace will split to include the WorkBench
        Uploader. The WorkBench Uploader includes 3 areas:<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Affected Tables</strong></em> lists the tables
        included in the data set file to be uploaded.<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Messages</strong></em> is used by the Uploader to
        present progress and other information to the user.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Buttons:</strong><br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li> <u>Validate</u> the data before allowing the upload.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li> <u>Upload</u> starts the upload.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li> <u>Settings</u> configures the upload for matching
            records.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <li> <u>Close</u> will close the Uploader.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>If you have not used the Validation tool then click the <em>Validate</em>
        button to validate the data at this time. This allows the data
        in the data set to be compared to the required fields and field
        formats in the Specify fields to which they are mapped. It also
        ensures that the necessary related fields are present to link
        multiple tables. When validation errors are present the Uploader
        will split the <em>Messages</em> window showing validation
        errors in the top portion and general messages below as well as
        a <em>View Report</em> button. Click the button to view and
        print a report of the validation errors. The Upload button will
        remain inactive until all validation errors have been corrected.
        Some errors may need to be fixed within the data set and require
        the user to exit the Uploader tool by clicking the <em>Close</em>
        button.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <em>Settings</em> button to configure the upload
        for processing matching records between the data set and the
        Specify database. It is important to note that when only one
        record is found in the data set that matches a record in the
        Specify database, the Uploader does not create a new record, but
        will use the matched record for any related information. For
        example, when uploading a Collection Object with Collecting
        Event data the Collecting Event may already exist in Specify.
        The Uploader matches the Collecting Event data in the data set
        to the existing record in Specify, and does not add a new
        Collecting Event in Specify, but does create a link between the
        Collection Object being uploaded and the existing Collecting
        Event in Specify.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Tables </strong></em>lists the tables that are
      included in the upload.<br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Match Action </strong></em>configures the Uploader
      response when more than one matching record is found.<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> <u>Prompt</u> will display the matching records in a
          dialog and require the user to choose which of the matching
          records to use. A choice to add a new record is also provided.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>Add New Record</u> will simply add a new record and not
          search for matches. This may cause duplicate records in the
          database.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>Pick First</u> will choose the first match found and not
          prompt the user. A message indicating these will appear in the
          message portion of the Uploader.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><u>Skip Row</u> will skip the matching data set record.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>Remember Choices</strong></em> will treat the first
        record with matches exactly as a 'Prompt' above, but will
        remember the choice and automatically use it again when
        identical values are found for succeeding records.<br>
        <br>
        <em><br>
          <strong>Match Empty Cells</strong></em> will search empty
        fields as part of the search criteria and require a match when
        set to <em>True</em> and disregard empty fields when set to <em>False</em>.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <li>Click Upload. While the upload is processing, each Table in
        the <em>Affected Tables</em> window keeps a tally of the number
        of records updated. The individual records that are updated are
        listed in the Messages window. The Upload can be paused at any
        time by clicking the <em>Pause</em> button on the status bar,
        or stopped by clicking the <em>Pause</em> button and then the <em>Close</em>
        button. Click the <em>Upload</em> button to start the upload
        process again. Any uploaded records can be discarded by clicking
        the <em>Undo</em> button on the Workspace. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Once the upload is complete the data is still not committed to
        the database. Both Query and Simple Searches can be used to
        examine the uploaded data before committing it. Records opened
        in a form from the results window are only available to view and
        can not be edited. Records in the results window can not be
        saved as Record Sets. The following buttons will be enabled on
        the Uploader:<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>View</strong></em> displays the uploaded records in
        a custom results page, indicating each table that is affected.
        These results can be printed, viewed in a form, or exported as
        an MS Excel file.<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Undo</strong></em> removes all uploaded data from
        the database.<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Close</strong></em> will open a dialog to <br>
      </li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Click the Save button to commit the uploaded records to the
        database.
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If a tree rank is included
            in an upload that has not been included in the Tree
            Definition, Specify will use the name of the file to label
            the undefined node. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When latitude and longitude
            values are entered into the WorkBench, the original value is
            captured into a hidden field to assist with format
            conversions. When data is uploaded into Specify, data from
            these fields is copied into the Specify (Source) field and
            will display on the Locality form.</p>
