<h2>Configuration Overview</h2>
<p>The Configuration tool within Specify is found by clicking <em>System &gt; Collection Setup &gt; Configuration</em> and offers many tools for setting up Specify for your specific institution as well as individual collections within the institution. The  Configuration tool (and menu) is only available to Administrators. </p>
<h4>Global Data </h4>
<p>The side bar offers Institution, Division, Discipline and Collection forms for adding these levels within Specify. Users that have run the Specify Setup Wizard  have their Institution as well as one Division, Discipline and Collection set up in Specify. If more of any of these Institutional levels are required within Specify they need to be added before any data is entered. Directions for performing these tasks can be found at <a href ../institution_hierarchy.html>Adding Collections, Disciplines and Divisions</a>.</p>
<h4>Discipline Data</h4>
<p>Pick Lists that are included on the default Specify forms are referred to as 'System Pick Lists' and can be edited for individual Disciplines within Specify. This is accomplished using the Pick List Editor. Please refer to <a href="../Picklist/system_picklist.html">Editing System Pick Lists</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>Preparation Types are Pick Lists that have an additional function; they determine if specimens with specific preparations can be loaned. For this reason they have a form for editing purposes. Simply click Preparation Type on the side bar to bring up the form. For additional information please refer to <a href="../prep_type.html">Editing the Preparation Type</a>.</p>
