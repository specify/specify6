<h2>Specify Setup</h2>
<p>Specify's flexible design can accommodate a single user with a single collection or multiple collections representing multiple disciplines within an institution - all sharing the same database. This is accomplished by creating relationships among collection data as well as modeling how collections are organized within institutions themselves and then configuring components within Specify specifically for each institutional level. </p>
<p>What this means for you, the  user, is that Specify 6 can be configured to work congruently with existing collection management procedures, but it requires a thoughtful setup process. This process may vary depending on how Specify was installed. If you were a Specify 5 user and have worked with the Specify staff to convert your data, many of the setup steps will have been performed for you. It is still recommended that you read the help sections for each of the modules to better understand how each module can be utilized for your specific needs. </p>
<p>Systems that were created by first running the Specify Setup Wizard will include one of each of the institutional levels (institution, division, discipline, collection and user). Most systems will require more than one of each of these institutional levels.</p>
<p><a href="../Configuration/institution_hierarchy.html">Add collections, disciplines and divisions</a> in the <em>System Configuration at System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>.</p>
<p>Once these institutional levels are configured users can be added to each of the collections. Specify  offers an extensive permission system which controls each user's access to both the data and tools within Specify.</p>
<p><a href="../Security/permissions.html">Add users and set user permissions</a> using the Security tools found at <em>System &gt; System Setup &gt; Security Tools</em>.</p>
<p>Once the institutional levels, users and permissions are complete, information specific to each discipline can be configured. </p>
<p>The Wizard created a Storage tree that can be accessed by the entire institution, and  Taxon, Geography, Lithostratigraphy and Chronostratigraphy (if applicable) trees for the discipline created by the Wizard. The ranks in the trees as well as the Enforced ranks and Full Name configuration were also created for that Division. It is recommended that users check these  <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">Tree D</a><a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">efinitions</a> before entering data as once data is entered the Full Name can not be changed. Tree Definitions are found by clicking the <img src="../../images/Tree-32x32.png" width="20" height="20" /> <em>Tree</em> button on the Tab Bar, then clicking the appropriate <em>Tree Definition</em> button on the side bar.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to create the Tree Definitions for trees in any other disciplines that have been added to your Institutional Hierarchy.</p>
<p><a href="../SchemaConfig/schema_config.html">Editing the schema</a> allows users to customize fields and tables within Specify for each of the disciplines. The Schema Configuration tool, found at <em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>, lists all the tables and fields within Specify along with their relationships and allows a variety of schema changes, such as hiding fields that are not used, changing captions, requiring fields and changing table and field formats as well as configuring table aggregation. </p>
<p><a href="../Intro/number_formats.html"></a>A variety of <a href="../PickList/system_picklist.html">System Pick Lists</a> exist within the Specify form system and exist as drop-down lists on forms. These can be edited in a System Configuration module, found at <em>System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em> along with the <a href="../Configuration/prep_type.html">Preparation Type</a> pick list.</p>
<p>It may also be useful to create <a href="../ReportsLabels/reports.html">reports</a> to be used within Specify. Reports may include labels for specimens or invoices for loans as well as reports for collection data. Each institution will have different needs but may find it helpful to have reports created before users start entering data into the database. Specify harnesses the power of iReport 3.0, an open source report writing software package, by modifying the original iReport version to  interact with Queries created in Specify 6 and data supplied from the Specify 6 database. <a href="../ReportsLabels/specifyireports.html">SpecifyiReport</a> is a separate application and must be launched separately from Specify. SpecifyiReport is located in the Specify application <em><strong>bin</strong></em> directory, which stores the executable files for Specify.</p>
<p>A <a href="../Restore/backup_restore.html">Backup and Restore</a> tool ships with Specify  as a separate application and allows IT personnel to backup and restore the database to the MySQL location on a server, or local disk. BackupAndRestore is located in the Specify application directory, in the <strong><em>bin</em></strong> file, which stores the executable files for Specify.</p>
