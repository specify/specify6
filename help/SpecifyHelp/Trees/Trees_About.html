<p>Specify 6 displays various table data in heirarchical tree format. These include Taxon, Geography, Storage, Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy. These tables are also included in the form system, but the tree offers a more broad, visual glimpse of the data. Data can be viewed, added and edited using both the form and tree system.</p>
<p>The Taxon, Geography,  Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy trees (and tables) are scoped at the Discipline level, meaning that all collections within a discipline share the same tree. Collections Objects that are associated with the nodes on the tree are only available for the collection (these are accessed from the tree by right-clicking the node and choosing <em>Associated Collection Objects </em>from the ensuing context menu.)</p>
<p>The Storage tree is scoped at the institution level, but as with the other trees only collection objects for the current collection will be shown when right-clicking on the node and choosing Associated Collection Objects from the context menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="trees_terms" id="trees_terms"></a>Specify Tree Terminology</h4>
<p>The various Trees show  relationships in a hierarchical structure. All hierarchies are referred to as <strong>ranks</strong>. All nodes immediately under a rank are referred to as <strong>children</strong>. Any node with a child is referred to as a <strong>parent</strong>.</p>
<p>Ranks are shown in columns on the tree.<em><strong> </strong></em>tree column colors can be set in <em>Preferences &gt; Tree</em>. See also <em><a href="../Prefs/Tree.html">Preferences</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><a name="trees_build" id="trees_build"></a>Building Ranks</strong></h4>
<p>Before creating a tree it is first necessary to create the <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def">Tree Definition</a>. This defines the Ranks for the tree, as well as how the ranks are enforced and if they are included in the full name. At this time in Specify 6 the configuration of full name can not be edited once nodes are placed on the tree. Therefore; this is a decision that must be made before populating the tree, and collections receiving databases with populated trees will need to request the desired configuration before import!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><a name="trees_build" id="trees_build"></a>Building Trees</strong></h4>
<p>Each of these Trees can be built in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manually by adding  one record at a time. This will be necessary for the Storage tree, as it is unique to each Institution and Collection.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Dynamically from an existing user database. This may include a conversion from Specify 5 or other type of database, which the Specify team can help with, or a data import through the WorkBench. </li>
  <br />
  <li>Dynamically by either downloading and importing an authority file from an authority source or taking advantage of a converted file from the Specify team. </li>

</ul>
<p>Specify has  converted Taxon authority files  from the Catalog of Life. These  are available as predefined, discipline-specific files that can either be preloaded into a blank database for those users wishing to start from scratch, or used to augment existing data by sending the Specify team your database for inclusion of this data.</p>
<p>Specify has also converted Geographic authority files from Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names and ships with data for Continent, Country, and States throughout the world. County data  for the United States is also included.</p>
<p>The Chronostratigraphy tree includes authority files for five ranks in the North American System as converted from the Geological Society of America. </p>
<p>The Lithostratigraphy tree includes four predefined ranks only. </p>
<p>Although it is possible to enter Trees in their entirety from within Specify 6, the Specify project does not recommend building  large Trees  manually. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="trees_using" id="trees_using"></a>Using Trees</h3>
<p>Trees are available through a tree button on the Taskbar. The Taskbar is configurable in Preferences. Users that do not have the tree button included on their Taskbar can add it by clicking <span class="MichaelsChanges"><em>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Taskbar </em>on Windows, or<em> Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; Taskbar</em> on the Mac, then checking the <em>Trees</em> box.</span></p>
<p>Users without permission to view or edit the tree can not have access in Preferences or the Taskbar.</p>
<p>Click <em><img src="../../images/Tree-32x32.png" width="20" height="20" /> Trees </em>on the Taskbar,  to open the tree tool. Trees are grouped by their task on the Sidebar.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Trees</strong> lists the Trees available for the collection. Click a tree to open it in the Workspace. </p>
<p><strong>Edit Tree Definitions</strong> lists the Definitions for each tree. This tool defines the ranks available in a  tree as well as with how these ranks are enforced in data entry and used in aggregating the full name. <em> </em>Before adding nodes to an empty tree, the tree Definition must be completed. Please refer to <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">Tree Definitions.</a></p>
<p><strong>Unlock a Tree</strong> is only available to users with appropriate permssion. </p>
<p>Only one user may edit  a tree, tree Definition or the related data entry form at the same time. Simultaneous editing of a tree, tree definition or data form is also not permitted by a single user. Trees and forms will still be available for viewing, searching or querying. In order for a second user to use the tree or form, the first user must close the affected tab. </p>
<p>When a tree is being edited by a user (A) and another user (B) opens the tree,  a prompt will notify user (B) that the tree is in use by user (A) and will open in View mode. Then the tree will open to view.</p>
<p>When a tree Definition is open and the same user opens the corresponding tree, the tree Definition does not need to be closed, the tree will display in the  tree tab. The Definition is not available to View and those without editing priviledges may not access it.</p>
<p>In the event that a tree becomes locked and the user of that tree can not be located, (which may occur due to improper shutdowns of the application), the tree can be unlocked by clicking it under the Unlock A Tree heading<em></em>.</p>

<p>If deletions are required, the condition or conditions preventing the deletion must first be eliminated. For example, open the related Collection Object record and delete the determination before deleting the tree node.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Any edits/additions to large trees may take several minutes to save. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="drag_drop">Dragging and Dropping</a></h3>
<p>Nodes can be dragged and dropped within a tree.  When the screen is split, nodes can be dragged and dropped within the same screen or into the opposite screen. A highlight box will appear around any nodes that can accept the node being dragged. Once the node is dropped onto the accepting node a dialog will appear allowing the user to reparent, synonymize (when applicable) or cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Reparent</strong>, or move a node (and its children) to a new parent. Reparenting a node is useful when a data entry error has occurred, or a new node has been introduced while uploading from the WorkBench. Nodes may be moved between ranks, but enforced ranks may not be skipped. </p>
<p><strong>Synonymize</strong> the node (in the Geography and Taxon trees only). The node that is dragged  and dropped becomes a synonym of the  accepting, or target node. The target node is then the Preferred node. Changes in taxon are refelected in fields in the Determinations table. Collection object determinations are captured in the Taxon and Preferred Taxon fields. When a taxon is not a synonymy these fields will both refer to the same taxon (A). If  taxon (A) becomes a synonymy of taxon (B) the Taxon field will still reflect Taxon (A) but the Preferred Taxon will change to Taxon (B). </p>
<p>Child nodes can not be added to a synonymized node and, in the same instance, parent nodes can not be synonymized unless their child nodes are first  synonymized.</p>
<p>In the Taxon tree, nodes at the species level and below can be synonymized within and between ranks, but any node higher than species can only be synonymized within the same rank. In other words, a family level node may only be synonymized to another family level node. </p>
<p>Synonyms are differentiated from non-synonyms by their text color. Synonym text color can be set in <em><a href="trees.html">Preferences</a></em>. Synonyms  also show as a tool tip on the node. Tool tips are displayed by holding the mouse over a rank. </p>
<p>To undo a synonymy right-click on the node, then click <em>Undo Synonymy</em> in the resulting Context Menu.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When taxa are synonymized the are created in the Taxon tree, the Preferred Taxon field on the Determination form is updated.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Cancel</strong> on the dialog to place the node back in its original position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="trees_counts" id="trees_counts"></a>Collection Object Counts</h3>
<p>Counts of collection objects associated with each node can be enabled for all trees. This feature requires data processing and therefore is not enabled by default. Enable Collection Object Counts  on a tree by choosing <em>Preferences &gt; Tree</em>. See also <em><a href="trees.html">Preferences</a></em>.</p>
<p>Counts are displayed next to the Node as two numbers (<strong>X</strong>,<strong>Y</strong>):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>X</strong> represents the number of Collection Objects for the Node only. </li>
  <li><strong>Y</strong> represents the number of Collection Objects for the Rank and all nodes beneath it. </li>
</ul>
<p>The last node on the tree will only show the X value, as there are no nodes beneath it.</p>
<p><strong><a name="trees_more" id="trees_more"></a>More Options</strong></p>
<p>A right-mouse click on the node offers the following choices:</p>
