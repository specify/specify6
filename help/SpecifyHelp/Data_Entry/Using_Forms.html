       <a name="form_overview">Using Forms</a> in Specify
    </h2>
    <p>
       A form is a window in which data can be viewed, entered, or edited. Specify categorizes
      forms as Data forms, which are used to enter collection data, and Interactions, which are
      used to record transactions of either data or collection objects. Each discipline has access
      to a set of forms for both data and interactions, specific to their discipline. The following
      sections describe basic concepts for using the form system. A separate section of help exists
      for both <a href="../Data_Entry/Data_Entry.html">Data</a> and <a href=
      "../Interactions/Interactions.html">Interactions</a> forms.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> At this time, Specify 6 does not include a Form Editor, as
        was found in Specify 5. It is important to note that the forms have been created
        programmatically to be extremely flexible and can be exported as xml and either edited by
        on-site staff or emailed to the Specify staff. The original forms should not be edited from
        the hard drive, they must be exported and then reimported! Forms are exported via the <a
        href="../Import/import_export.html">Importing/Exporting</a> tool, which exports an entire
        form set. Form sets reside at the Discipline level in Specify, which means that all
        Collections within a Discipline access the same forms, but form sets can then be reimported
        at any institutional level. For instance, the default form set for a discipline could be
        exported, edited, and reimported at a collection level, allowing all users in that
        collection to use the new set of forms. Members of the Specify Collections Consortium may
        contact our help desk at <b>support@specifysoftware.org</b> for help editing their forms.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       The names of tables and fields used for display within Specify, (labels), can be edited
      using the <a href="../SchemaConfig/schema_config.html">Schema Configuration</a> tool.
    </p>
    <p>
       Specific forms have been created for each of the operating systems. These include varying
      font sizes as well as static versus stretchy forms. The form layout can be chaged in the user
      preferences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="michaelschanges">
        For Mac: Choose <em>Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; Formatting.</em>
      </li>
      <li class="michaelschanges">
        For Windows and Linux: Choose <em>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Formatting</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="forms_permissions"></a>Permissions
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Specify includes extensive controls for limiting access to data for each user. When
        starting up, Specify reads the permissions for the user based on their login information,
        then loads the correct tables and tools based on these permissions. For this reason, some
        of the controls and/or data may not be available. For example, users that belong to the
        Guest group and only have permission to view tables and forms will not have access to data
        through the Data module. They must first Query to find records, then view the data in a
        form.
      </p>
      <p>
         Also, if a user has permission to view forms, but does not have permission to view a
        particular table or tables included within the form, they will be advised that the data is
        restricted. For instance, in the example below the user has permission to view a Collection
        Object form, but not a Preparations form. When opened, the Preparations sub form does not
        have permission to view any Preparations data, but it does have View permission for both
        the form system and Collection Object table.

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Forms are categorized for the data that resides in each table (Collection Object, Taxon,
        Geography, etc.); however, much of the data within the tables is also linked to related
        tables. This prevents users from needing to retype the same information and assures that
        information is entered only one way (for example John Smith is not also entered as J. Smith
        or John Smyth). Separating data into fields within tables with relationships also allows
        data to be searched in a more precise way.
      </p>
      <h4>
         <strong><u>Many-to-One</u></strong>
      </h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
           A relationship involving a primary and related table in which many primary records are
          linked to a single related record in the related table is referred to as having a
          many-to-one relationship. For example, many Collection Object records might be linked to
          the same Locality record because the specimens were all found at the same location.
        </p>
        <p>
           Related tables with a many-to-one relationship to the primary table are represented on
          the form as a formatted field with buttons to edit, add and search for a record within
          the table. The field format typically consists of one primary field within the table, but
          may be represented by more than one field typically separated by a comma.
        </p>

      <h4>
         <u>One-to-Many</u>
      </h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
           A relationship involving a primary and related table in which a single primary record
          links to many related records in the related table is referred to as a one-to-many
          relationship. For example, several Collection Object records would be linked to a single
          record in the Collection Event table because all the specimens were collected during the
          same event.

               The clone tool is only available on the collection object form in the locality field

              record. It will open a locality form with all the information from the existing
              locality. Changes can be made to the form and a new locality record will be created.

             A Query Combo Box represents a many-to-one relationship with another record in another
            table. Data for each record in the table is formatted to display enough fields within
            the table for the desired record to be recognized within a list of records. A Query
            Combo Box used to represent the Taxon (shown above), Geography, Storage,
            Lithostratigraphy and Chronostratigraphy tables will use the format for the Full Name,
            which is configured in the <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html#tree_ranks">Taxon
            Tree Definition</a>. Other queries and resulting lists are configured in the system and
            are not editable at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
             The Query Combo Box allows data to be searched and chosen from a related table, not
            typed directly into the box. Data chosen from the list links the current record with a
            record in a related table. This eliminates the need to retype data. It is possible to
            type data directly into the box, but the box will not accept the data; the data must
            first be added to the table by clicking the <img height="16" alt="add" src=
            "../../images/add.png" width="16">&nbsp;(add) button and creating a new record.
          </p>

           Any string can be formatted to a numbering scheme in <em>System &gt; Schema

          <p>
             <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> When manually entering a formatted number field, it is
            paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a
            numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1
            is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in

           Specify 6 allows values in specific fields to be copied from the current record into new

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter data into a form and click Save.

           Carry Forward automatically turns on after being Configured.
        </p>
        <p>
           When Carry Forward is already configured, it can be turned on by choosing <em>Data &gt;
          Carry Forward</em> or right-button clicking within the form and choosing <em>Carry
          Forward</em> in the context menu. A checkmark will appear next to the name <em>Carry
          Forward</em> in both the drop-down and context menus.
        </p>
        <p>
           To disable Carry Forward choose <em>Data &gt; Carry Forward</em> or right-button click

          Events and Citations for Collection Objects. These three will carry forward all the
          associated records. For example, if a Collection Object has 6 Determinations associated
          with it and Carry Forward is enabled <strong>all</strong> 6 of the Determinations will
          carry forward into the new record.

             <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Fields that are check boxes, or use an auto-formatter

            update using Auto Numbering. For instance, Catalog Number is a field that is always
            formatted for a numbering scheme. If the Catalog Number (C#)is 1234 and Carry Forward
            is turned on but Auto Numbering is turned off then the the next record will not include
            a C# (one will need to be entered manually). If the C# is 1234 and Carry Forward and
            Auto Numbering are both turned on then the next record added will include a C# of 1235.

      <h4>

      </h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
           Fields that have been formatted for a numbering scheme automatically increment their
          numbering scheme using Auto Numbering. These are typically the Catalog, Accession, Gift
          and Loan Number fields, but any field that is a string can be formatted using the Schema
          Configuration tool (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>). Forms open with Auto
          Numbering on. Turn off Auto Numbering by choosing <em>Data &gt; Auto Numbering</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
           Once Auto Numbering is turned off it will stay off until the Workspace window is closed;
          however, new windows will open with Auto Numbering turned on. For instance, if a
          Collection Object (CO) form is opened and Auto Numbering is turned off, it will remain
          off while new CO's are entered using the same window. If a new CO form is opened in a new
          window (creating a new tab) it will open with Auto Numbering turned on.
        </p>
        <p>
           When Auto Numbering is not on, formatted numbers must be manually assigned. This is
          useful when entering legacy data. When manually entering a formatted number field, it is
          paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a
          numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1
          is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in
          searches, queries and reports.

       <u><a name="editing_related_records"></a></u>How Editing Affects Related Records
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Records that are related, or linked, to other records can not be deleted. For example, a
        Preparation that is linked to specific Collection Objects can not be deleted while the link
        and/or Collection Object exists. To delete the Preparation, first edit each Collection
        Object record and remove the Preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
         When related records are edited, the data changes in each record that references that
        data. For example, if the spelling of a name in the Last Name field is changed in the Agent
        record, the spelling will also change in the Deaccession Agents, Loan Agents, Authors and
        other records.

      <p>
         Multiple records can be entered within a single tab in Specify. Records can also be
        deleted from within that original tab. Once the original tab has been closed, the record
        will need to be searched and reopened within a form to delete it from the database. The
        following example shows the steps to delete a Collection Object record with Catalog Number
        100.

       Count Fields
    </h3>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Calculated fields in Specify track the number of Collection Objects and Preparations in a
      Collection. These are not in the Specify schema, but rather are written in the code and
      automatically updated. They are included on the default forms in Specify 6.8.01. For forms
      created prior to this release please contact support@specifysoftware.org.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The suggested field names for calculated fields associated with Collection Objects:
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <u>Total Counts</u>: The number of items that were ever part of a Collection Object,
      typically the original number.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <u>Total Current Counts</u>: The number it items still physically associated with the
      Collection Object i.e. the original number minus any items that have been Gifted, Exchanged
      Out, or Disposed.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The suggested field name for calculated Preparations field:
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <u>Current Count</u>: The number of items originally entered in the Count Amount field (a
      user-editable field in the Specify schema) minus any items that have been Gifted, Exchanged
      Out, or Disposed.
    </p>

       <a name="unique_identifier" id="unique_identifier">Unique Identifier</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       Tracking information in the database is easier if there is a way to identify, and therefore
      search, for a particular record. This can be accomplished by placing an identifier on the
      record, such as a Collection Object Number on each&nbsp;Collection Object. It is further
      helpful if the identifier is unique within a Collection or Discipline. For this reason the
      Specify schema has included fields that are forced to be unique within the Collection Object,
      Preparation, Locality, and Collecting Event tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collection Object field is
      required to be unique in the Specify schema, but can be changed if necessary. Barcode in the
      Preparation table is also forced to be unique and fields named uniqueIdentifier are included
      in both the Locality and Collecting Event tables with enforced uniqueness.&nbsp;
