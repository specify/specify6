    <h2>
       <a name="form_overview">Using Forms</a> in Specify
    </h2>
    <p>
       A form is a window in which data can be viewed, entered, or edited. Specify categorizes
      forms as Data forms, which are used to enter collection data, and Interactions, which are
      used to record transactions of either data or collection objects. Each discipline has access
      to a set of forms for both data and interactions, specific to their discipline. The following
      sections describe basic concepts for using the form system. A separate section of help exists
      for both <a href="../Data_Entry/Data_Entry.html">Data</a> and <a href=
      "../Interactions/Interactions.html">Interactions</a> forms.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> At this time, Specify 6 does not include a Form Editor, as
        was found in Specify 5. It is important to note that the forms have been created
        programmatically to be extremely flexible and can be exported as xml and either edited by
        on-site staff or emailed to the Specify staff. The original forms should not be edited from
        the hard drive, they must be exported and then reimported! Forms are exported via the <a
      href="../Import/import_export.html">Importing/Exporting</a> tool, which exports an entire
        form set. Form sets reside at the Discipline level in Specify, which means that all
        Collections within a Discipline access the same forms, but form sets can then be reimported
        at any institutional level. For instance, the default form set for a discipline could be
        exported, edited, and reimported at a collection level, allowing all users in that collection
        to use the new set of forms. If you wish to have a member of the Specify team edit the form
        and have an ISA with Specify, please contact them at <strong>specify@ku.edu</strong>.      </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
       The names of tables and fields used for display within Specify, (labels), can be edited
      using the <a href="../SchemaConfig/schema_config.html">Schema Configuration</a> tool.
    </p>
    <p>
       Specific forms have been created for each of the operating systems. These include varying
      font sizes as well as static versus stretchy forms. The form layout can be chaged in the user
      preferences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="michaelschanges">
        For Mac: Choose <em>Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; Formatting.</em>
      </li>
      <li class="michaelschanges">
        For Windows and Linux: Choose <em>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Formatting</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;
       
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="forms_permissions"></a>Permissions
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Specify includes extensive controls for limiting access to data for each user. When starting
        up, Specify reads the permissions for the user based on their login information, then loads
        the correct tables and tools based on these permissions. For this reason, some of the
        controls and/or data may not be available. For example, users that belong to the Guest group
        and only have permission to view tables and forms will not have access to data through the
        Data module. They must first Query to find records, then view the data in a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if a user has permission to view forms, but does not have permission to view a
        particular table or tables included within the form, they will be advised that the data is
        restricted. For instance, in the example below the user has permission to view a Collection
        Object form, but not a Preparations form. When opened, the Preparations  subform does not have permission to view any Preparations data, but it does have View permission
        for both the form system and Collection Object table.      </p>

       <u><a name="forms_related_information"></a></u>Related Information    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Forms are categorized for the data that resides in each table (Collection Object, Taxon,
        Geography, etc.); however, much of the data within the tables is also linked to related
        tables. This prevents users from needing to retype the same information and assures that
        information is entered only one way (for example John Smith is not also entered as J. Smith
        or John Smyth). Separating data into fields within tables with relationships also allows data
        to be searched in a more precise way.      </p>
      <h4><strong>
       <u>Many-to-One</u> </strong></h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A relationship involving a primary and related table in which many primary records are
          linked to a single related record in the related table is referred to as having a many-to-one
          relationship. For example, many Collection Object records might be linked to the same
          Locality record because the specimens were all found at the same location.        </p>
        <p>
          Related tables with a many-to-one relationship to the primary table are represented on the
          form as a formatted field with buttons to edit, add and search for a record within the table.
          The field format typically consists of one primary field within the table, but may be
          represented by more than one field typically separated by a comma.        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>
        <u>One-to-Many</u> </h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A relationship involving a primary and related table in which a single primary record links
          to many related records in the related table is referred to as a one-to-many relationship.
          For example, several Collection Object records would be linked to a single record in the
          Collection Event table because all the specimens were collected during the same event.    </p>

      <p>
        Related tables with a one-to-many relationship to the primary table are included on the form
        as a sub form with navigation controls.

        Data is added and edited in sub forms the same way that it is added and edited to forms.

        <img height="32" alt="image" src="../../images/text_from_field.png" width="573">      </p>
      <p>
        A Query Combo Box represents a many-to-one relationship with another record in another
        table. Data for each record in the table is formatted to display enough fields within the
        table for the desired record to be recognized within a list of records. A Query Combo Box
        used to represent the Taxon (shown above), Geography, Storage, Lithostratigraphy and
        Chronostratigraphy tables will use the format for the Full Name, which is configured in the
        <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html#tree_ranks">Taxon Tree Definition</a>. Other queries
        and resulting lists are configured in the system and are not editable at this time.      </p>
      <p>
        The Query Combo Box allows data to be searched and chosen from a related table, not typed
        directly into the box. Data chosen from the list links the current record with a record in a
        related table. This eliminates the need to retype data. It is possible to type data directly
        into the box, but the box will not accept the data; the data must first be added to the table
        by clicking the <img height="16" alt="add" src="../../images/add.png" width="16">&nbsp;(add)
        button and creating a new record. </p>
      <p>
        Choose data from a list:      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Type the first lette, or first few letters of the term you wish to use in the box, then
          either click on the <img height="16" alt="down" src="../../images/Down16x16.png" width=
        "16"> button or use the down-arrow key on the keyboard. A list of data starting with the
          typed letter(s) will appear. </li>
        <li> If Specify can not find a match based on the typed letters, then an <img height="27" alt=
        "add" src="../../images/add_form.png" width="81"> button will appear. Click the button or
          press the enter key to add a new record. </li>
        <li> If the required data is not in the resulting list, either press the enter key when 'Add
          ...' is in focus, or click the <img height="16" alt="add" src="../../images/add.png" width=

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Fields that have been formatted for a numbering scheme automatically increment their
          numbering scheme using Auto Numbering. These are typically the Catalog, Accession, Gift and
          Loan Number fields, but any field that is a string can be formatted using the Schema
          Configuration tool (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>). Forms open with Auto
          Numbering on. Turn off Auto Numbering by choosing <em>Data &gt; Auto Numbering</em>.        </p>
        <p>
          Once Auto Numbering is turned off it will stay off until the Workspace window is closed;
          however, new windows will open with Auto Numbering turned on. For instance, if a Collection
          Object (CO) form is opened and Auto Numbering is turned off, it will remain off while new CO's
          are entered using the same window. If a new CO form is opened in a new window (creating a new
          tab) it will open with Auto Numbering turned on.        </p>
        <p>
          When Auto Numbering is not on, formatted numbers must be manually assigned. This is useful
          when entering legacy data. When manually entering a formatted number field, it is paramount
          that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a numbering
          scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1 is entered,
          then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in searches, queries
          and reports.    </p>

    <u><a name="forms_barcodes"></a></u>Using Barcodes    </h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    As in Specify 5, Specify 6 works with a bar code reader. Specify treats the bar code reader
   as an ordinary data entry device. No special configuration within Specify is necessary. Refer
   to your bar code reader documentation for instructions on how to install and configure the
   bar code reader. Once the bar code reader is successfully installed and configured, it should
   work automatically in Specify 6.

    <h3>
       <u><a name="editing_related_records"></a></u>How Editing Affects Related Records    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Records that are related, or linked, to other records can not be deleted. For example, a
        Preparation that is linked to specific Collection Objects can not be deleted while the link
        and/or Collection Object exists. To delete the Preparation, first edit each Collection Object
        record and remove the Preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When related records are edited, the data changes in each record that references that data.
        For example, if the spelling of a name in the Last Name field is changed in the Agent record,
        the spelling will also change in the Deaccession Agents, Loan Agents, Authors and other
        records.
      </p>

       <a name="delete_record"></a>Deleting Records
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Multiple records can be entered within a single tab in Specify. Records can also be deleted
        from within that original tab. Once the original tab has been closed, the record will need to
        be searched and reopened within a form to delete it from the database. The following example
        shows the steps to delete a Collection Object record with Catalog Number 100.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use Simple Search or the Query tool to find Catalog Number 100.      </li>
