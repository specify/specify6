<p>The WorkBench is able to run from a USB key. This is especially useful when entering data from the field or sharing data with a collaborating institution. </p>
<p>Simply copy the root WorkBench directory onto the USB key. To update the WorkBench Data Sets on your computer's hard drive copy the WorkBench directory back onto the hard drive from the USB key and allow the USB  files to overwrite the hard drive files. </p>
