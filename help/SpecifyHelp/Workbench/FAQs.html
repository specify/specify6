<h2>Usage Scenarios/Work Flow</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Workbench is designed to facilitate the entry of various kinds of data into the Workbench using numerous tools and workflows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellpadding="8">
  <tr>
    <td><u><strong>Data Type</strong></u></td>
    <td><u><strong>Action</strong></u></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have data in an Excel spreadsheet</td>
    <td> The &quot;Import Data&quot; action will import the data into a Data Set and map the existing Columns into the Specify Fields.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have data in a database </td>
    <td>Export the data as a CSV file and use the &quot;Import Data&quot; action to import the data into a Data Set and map the existing Columns into Specify Fields. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have legacy data on scanned cards </td>
    <td>The &quot;Import Images&quot; action will create a Data Set with each card image linked to a single record. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have legacy data on cards </td>
    <td>The &quot;New Data Set&quot; action will create an empty Data Set for entering data from the cards. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have locality information on field notes</td>
    <td>The &quot;New Data Set&quot; action will create an empty Data Set for entering data from the field notes. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to create labels from my field notes</td>
    <td>Use the &quot;New Data Set&quot; action to create an empty Data Set to enter the field notebook information, then create the labels by dragging and dropping the Data Set onto the Basic Label.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be going into the field and want to enter (Andy what might be entered in the field?) </td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be visiting a collaborating Institution and want to take my data with me </td>
    <td>Save the entire WorkBench Component and accompanying Data Sets onto a USB key. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be visiting a collaborating Institution and want to take my data with me but they use a Mac and I use PC </td>
    <td>No problem! The WorkBench works the same on systems using Windows, Mac OS X as well as Linux. Simply ave the entire WorkBench Component and accompanying Data Sets onto a USB key and run the entire WorkBench on your associate's Macintosh.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be visiting a collaborating Institution and want to be able to merge our data but they only use Excel  </td>
    <td>The &quot;Export Data Set&quot; action will export your data into an Excel spreadsheet. If you make changes to the data (not the Columns) while it is in the spreadsheet use &quot;Import Data&quot; to bring it back into the Workbench. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have data in Specify 5 that I would like to switch to Specify 6 </td>
    <td>The WorkBench is a component of Specify 6 and  cannot be used for converting data from Specify 5 to Specify 6. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I want to verify my data that exists in a non-Specify database </td>
    <td><p>Export the data as a CSV file from your database and then use the &quot;Import Data&quot; action to import the data into a WorkBench Data Set by mapping the existing columns into Specify Fields. Then you can use the reporting features to verify your data. </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would like to link collection images to my existing Data Set </td>
    <td>The WorkBench allows each record to link to one image. Use &quot;Import Data&quot; to import the data into a Data Set, then link the images to the records. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would like to Georeference my data </td>
    <td>Data in the WorkBench  can be Georeferenced using BioGiomancer. (must list the neccesary fields here) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The latitude and longitude references in my data exist in different formats and I would like make them all the same. </td>
    <td>The WorkBench includes a Lat/Long Converter. OPen the Data Set and click on the Converter button in the Grid View. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My data is in Specify 5 but I want to take advantage of the special features in the Workbench </td>
